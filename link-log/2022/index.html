They are assigned as Guardians of their region (villages) by goddess Chamundeshwari ( one of the fierce form of Goddess parvati ). These two deities also regard Goddess parvati as their mother. The belief is that the holy guardian forest sprit Panjurli (which is in the form of a wild boar) and Guliga protect the forest and the people living off of the forest. During this dance performance its believed the dancers go in trance and divine sprit communicates through them to address any concerns devotees would have.\nFor example if I have a difficult decision to take like should I pursue a certain job or sell a certain property or family disputes and problems they seek audience with the divine sprite communicating through the dancer. The gesture of dancer tapping hands in there chest is a sign of assurance of protection ( meaning I am there for you ). The different gestures mean different things and it can vary from assurance, warning to touching of hands to warm hugs. Its said out of the audience the sprit will read your heart and choose who to communicate to.
