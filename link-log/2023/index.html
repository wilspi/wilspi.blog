The man walked all the way, fought a battle, burned down a city to get back his wife Yes, he fought, waged a battle, but I don‚Äôt think it was purely for his wife, it was for himself too, for his pride. Raavan kidnapped Sita to hurt Ram, women in those ages (even today) were a prized possession. He put his duty towards his people before his duty towards his wife. If the counterargument is - he fought a battle to save his wife, so no ^ That was the norm back then - a very cruel patriarchy society. He did best out of these norms. You judge by the norms of the society, say we lived in a world where you are praised for how many people you kill, a peaceful person would be a very bad example in the society. Society wants examples of characteristics they want to inculcate and history remembers people who are great examples. Currently our society is divided into extreme patriarchs (disguised under the name of religion) and extreme feminists. Kevin spoke with his early users as to what they like about burbn, why do they use it, they said its because of photo sharing. He built filters because his user told his photos are not that great. - Story of Instagram Reacting on Random videos - feminism World works on capitalism and not on values like equality - hence there is no equal pay. What brings in more money gets more money, eg: female models get higher paychecks than their male counterparts because fashion industry is more female oriented If you are conservative and traditional than most, and you have standards for your man, what is it that you have to offer? just yourself? isnt that being entitlement? Most guys are invisible to most woman, guys are socially weird because they dont get female attention. Guys dont get laid that often and hence they chase it more.
