Chlorine and other chemicals used to keep pool water clean can wash away the moist layer of tear film, leaving eyes uncomfortable and red. People who swim frequently may develop dry eye, where they don‚Äôt produce enough tears or the right quality of tears. Wear a pair of swim goggles every time you swim. Goggles keep pool chemicals out of your eyes, helping to keep your tear film healthy. Splash your closed eyes with fresh water immediately after swimming. This washes chlorine and other chemicals off your eyelids and eyelashes. Use over-the-counter lubricating eye drops before and after swimming to keep the tear film balanced and eyes comfortable. 04/09/2023\nGender Vs Sex 01/09/2023\nSwimming strokes Breaststroke Butterfly Freestyle Backstroke 27/08/2023\nPodcast with India‚Äôs top urologist and sexologist - Dr. Vijayant Govinda Gupta Viagra drugs Sildenafil - https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699015.html This is the original Viagra Stimulation Doesnt work if your stomach is full or if you have drunk alcohol It requires time - 2-2.5 hrs to kick in Meant for older men - who are preplanning intercourse Younger folks are taking it for confidence, not ED Have after effects - headache, temporary color blindness Take only for recreational purpose - 12.5mg, taking it regularly will have major bad effects Tadalaphil - https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a604008.html Much safer than viagra Kicks in much early, can be eaten with food Still better to take 1.5hrs before the action, spend time in foreplay Other variations for younger generation (weekend viagra - for 3-4 days) Viagra does not mean erection, it helps but only if you have stimulation Kegel exercise - https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14611-kegel-exercises Good for improving erection quality Masturbation is not a good habit We are the only species where we watch another human being get intercourse and we ejaculate to that Kamasutra talks about 52 senses (apart from positions - which is what Kamasutra have been reduced to) No mention of masturbation in Kamasutra or any of our ancient texts Penis Massage is good, its differnt from masturbation Men are supposed to be polygamous We are living in a stupid world - a woke world Pressure of sex is on men Women demand their orgasms from men (that is the expectation).

Resulted in its 15 constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991 Last Leader of Soviet Union - Mikhail Gorbachev History 1917‚Äì1927: Establishment 1927‚Äì1953: Stalinism 1953‚Äì1964: Khrushchev Thaw 1964‚Äì1982: Era of Stagnation 1982‚Äì1991: Decline and collapse Somewhere on the Internet - It all starts with parents. Children who grow up in unreasonably strict environments grow up to fear teachers and see school and exams as punishments. They grow up to become timid, shy, reserved and scared teenagers. They continue the same attitude into adulthood and see their bosses as gods and do what they are told to do and never stand up for themselves. All these factors lead to failure in professional and personal lives of such individuals. I‚Äôm a prime example of this and the above is my own story. At 40, I am now becoming more assertive and am re-inventing myself in every aspect.\nTo all parents : PLEASE DO NOT FORCE YOUR CHILDREN TO DO ANYTHING AND STOP COMPARING YOUR KID WITH OTHER KIDS. The Corporate Game 1 Ensure visibility and credit 2 Be in limelight 3 Compete wherever possible 4 Don‚Äôt be nice and simple, be deplomatic 5 Be close to your manager Everyone has equal time to spend. If someone is having a good time, you can too. Everyone, how rich or privileged, has same amount of time as you (assuming equal lifetime). You wasting any of that time on sulking or feeling sad/jealous is your loss of time - the other person is already having a good time, and you are deliberately losing (time). 26/08/2023\nReality of Indian Media News Agencies - sell news to newspapers and tv channels ANI - Asian News International PTI - Press Trust of India has its own satellite 25/08/2023\nNanjing Massacre Japanese attacked Nanjing (1937) and committed many atrocities on Chineses and war crimes Nanking Event 22/08/2023\nRock Skipper (on water) interviewed by Wired Next global superpower - TED talk 20/08/2023\nhttps://www.lovetoknow.com/home/cleaning/how-clean-clear-phone-case-make-it-good-as-new 19/08/2023\nOral Health Essentials Brush twice a day - ideal Mouthwash such as Listerine contains alcohol, you can use once in a while, using daily is harmful for teeth Toothpaste contains flouride which helps in preventing tooth decay, you should let the flouride settle in your teeth for 10-15 min, so either brush your teeth for 10-15min or after brushing rinse your mouth with water after 10-15 min Expressway Vs Highway Expressway are access controlled - vehicles can move in or out via interchanges only.

The man walked all the way, fought a battle, burned down a city to get back his wife Yes, he fought, waged a battle, but I don‚Äôt think it was purely for his wife, it was for himself too, for his pride. Raavan kidnapped Sita to hurt Ram, women in those ages (even today) were a prized possession. He put his duty towards his people before his duty towards his wife. If the counterargument is - he fought a battle to save his wife, so no ^ That was the norm back then - a very cruel patriarchy society. He did best out of these norms. You judge by the norms of the society, say we lived in a world where you are praised for how many people you kill, a peaceful person would be a very bad example in the society. Society wants examples of characteristics they want to inculcate and history remembers people who are great examples. Currently our society is divided into extreme patriarchs (disguised under the name of religion) and extreme feminists. Kevin spoke with his early users as to what they like about burbn, why do they use it, they said its because of photo sharing.

What brings in more money gets more money, eg: female models get higher paychecks than their male counterparts because fashion industry is more female oriented If you are conservative and traditional than most, and you have standards for your man, what is it that you have to offer? just yourself? isnt that being entitlement? Most guys are invisible to most woman, guys are socially weird because they dont get female attention. Guys dont get laid that often and hence they chase it more.
