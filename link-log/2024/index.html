Why did you spill the coffee? You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. The point is whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out. Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which will happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It‚Äôs easy to fake it, until you get rattled. So, we have to ask ourselves, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in my cup?‚Äù When life gets tough, what spills out? Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility? Or does anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions come out? You choose! Today let‚Äôs work towards filling our cups with gratitude, giveness, joy, words of affirmation, kindness, gentleness and love for others. We project our insecurities onto others The adults will tell you to stop looking for the spark. To settle for stability and companionship. But I don‚Äôt think I can sit next to someone on the dinner table for the rest of my life talking only about my day. There needs to be unsaid communication. The sarcasm that doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. The teasing that doesn‚Äôt stop. That chemistry that you can‚Äôt find from just a good resume. Key to having a good conversation: endless q-n-a mixed with jokes and stories Are you successful? It depends on the context. Success is not a state but a transition so you need a context.

Yes, but eating some bacteria isn‚Äôt what hurts you. Your stomach handles bacteria every day, surfaces are covered with them. However, when bacteria and fungi have been growing for a while on food, they‚Äôve eaten some of it and, well, pooped. The toxins they release after they eat are designed to kill things, like other microbes looking to ‚Äúshare‚Äù the food that the current diners have found.\nPenicillin is the poop of the Penicillium chrysogenum bacteria fungus, released to keep others from sharing the bread P.C. is living on. (Fun bonus fact, a relatives Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium camemberti are used because we like the flavor their poop gives cheese.)\nEnough microwaves to destroy these toxin molecules would virtually incinerate your food.\nFitness routine Starting weight: 63kg/139lbs Weight now: 85kg/187lbs Height: 186 cm/6'1 Age: 19 Routine: Monday (Pull) Bench 7-6-5-4-3-2-2 Deadlifts 7-6-5-4-3-2-2 Weighted pullups 4x8+ Cable rows 3x12+ Face pulls 3x15+ Hammer curls 3x12+ Ez bar curls 3x10+ Tuesday (Push) Overhead Press 5-3-1+, 5x5 Shoulder press 1x15+, 1x10+, 1x6+, 1x15+ Close grip bench 3x8+ Peck deck 1x20+, 1x15+, 1x10+ Lateral raises 5x15+ Triceps pushdowns 3x12+ Front raises 3x15+ Wednesday (Legs) Squats 7-6-5-4-3-2-2 Lunges 3x10+ Leg press 3x15+ Leg curls 3x10+ Calf raises 5x10+ Thursday(Pull) Barbell rows 1x17+, 1x10+, 1x6+, 1x15+ Lat pulldowns 3x8+ Pullups 3x12+ Cable rows 3x12+ Face pulls 3x15+ Hammer curls 3x12+ Ez bar curls 3x10+ Friday (Push) ATG squat 1 heavy single Bench 6-5-5-4-3-2-1 Incline dumbell bench 4x10+ Shoulder press 3x12+ Peck deck 1x20+, 1x15+, 1x10+ Lateral raises 5x20 Triceps pushdowns 3x12+ Skullcrushers 3x10+ Saturday (Legs) Squats 6-5-5-4-3-2-1 RDL‚Äôs 1x20 ish, 1x15 ish, 1x10 ish Front squats 3x10+ Hamstring curls 3x10+ Calf raises 5x15+ Diet routine: Tried to eat at least 3500 calories every day, aswell as getting around 150g protein/day, other than that, not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect theory that when facing an economic crisis consumers will be more willing to buy less costly luxury goods instead of buying expensive purses and fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive cosmetics, such as high-end brands of lipstick https://growth.design/ Brilliant case studies on UX Book Suggestion: Neil Postman‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmusing Ourselves to Death‚Äù, Album Suggestion: Arctic Monkey‚Äôs album ‚ÄúTranquility Base Hotel \u0026 Casino‚Äù Five most important controllable factors from the Pardot experience Employees-First ‚Äì Our focus on culture was maniacal. Employees came before customers and all other constituents. Everything we did internally was focused on our core values of positive, self-starting, and supportive. The ultimate reason we succeeded was because of our people. In the Path of Revenue ‚Äì Our product unequivocally helped our customers make more money. We showed return on investment. We showed value. Our product helped turn marketing from a fuzzy role to a metrics-driven role. Must-Have Product ‚Äì Our product was the core of the majority of the B2B marketing functions. If you ripped it out, many of the marketing channels stopped working (email, lead forms, etc.). It was not a nice-to-have. Complementary Co-Founders ‚Äì Adam and I are very different yet complemented each other incredibly well. We knew our strengths and weaknesses and built an awesome organization. Focused Solution ‚Äì Our product delivered the most value with the best experience possible at the $1,000/month price point. We were focused on providing the most bang-for-your-buck in the SMB market, and we executed well. This was especially important as our market was so noisy. 27/02/2024\nhttps://trash-guides.info/ https://sonarr.tv/#downloads-linux-archlinux 26/02/2024\nCompare cost of living of any city Alternatives for Docker Desktop podman colima 12/02/2024\n5 most used architecture patterns Layered architecture Presentation Layer Business Layer Persistence Layer Database Layer Event Driven CQRS Microkernel * Plugins Microservices Monolithic Architecture How to Crack Any System Design Interview Purpose is to assess your ability to Translate an ambiguous problem statement into concrete technical requirements Craft an architecture and design that satisfies those requirements Articulate and defend your design decisions throughout the discussion There is no correct solution, goal is to demonstrate your technical expertise, your approach to problem solving, your sills to communicate effectively Understand Features NFR - Non Functional Requirements Scalability Technical Constraints Important Numbers Use Cases Scoping Deployment Strategies Big Bang Deployment Rolling Deployment Blue Green Deployment Canary Deployment Feature Flags Deployment 11/02/2024\nHow Europe lost Hollywood Germany used to be film capital in world First commercial movie theatre opened in Paris 1895 France and Italy dominated early on California has vast amount of different landscapes and perfect weather conditions (more sun, more lighting) Tech Interview Handbook 10/02/2024\nHuberman podcast - science of love, desire, attachment men find women‚Äôs odour more attractive and women find men more attractive - in pre ovulatory phase of women‚Äôs menstrual cycle Jewelbox - Lab grown diamonds Startup at Shark Tank Season 3 Lab grown diamonds are diamonds but artificially made Codeium Alternate to Github Copilot, claims to be better Gemini - Google Bard‚Äôs next version Alternate to Chatgpt Acko \u003c\u003e Ola Insurance - Golden Peacock Award - old news 09/02/2024\nwhat attracts men to women Her looks catch my attention, her personality is what gets me to stay Second to looks is femininity.

Automate boring parts of your job using robotic process automation (RPA) Men Clothing Brand - XY XX Secrets of successful relationship Pick someone you feel profoundly grateful ever decided to look your way. Start from a sense that you are the lucky one, and they are superior, truth is irrelevant. Make sure you fancy them intimately. Allow yourselves both to admit from an early stage that you are ‚Äòmad‚Äô, heavily distorted by your past, unable to understand yourseleves. Make apology the most regular of occurrences. Remove all pride from your character. Regularly explore how you have disappointed one another. Let them sometimes hate you, and you them. Never describe them categorically as this or that. (i.e. ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre being unfair‚Äù, not ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being unfair‚Äù) Get good at sensing the fear beneath your angry moods, then express the fear gently rather than acting out the anger. Reduce expectations of perfection. Accept you will have crushes on others. If there are children, recognize that love will suffer hugely. Become the sort of person who has no embarrassment about being ‚Äòneedy‚Äô. Read up about attachment theory. Stop being defensive. Accept that they can‚Äôt save you from your own disturbances. Don‚Äôt expect everything from love. Be very prepared (though reluctant) to leave. 06/02/2024\nBecome a more interesting person There is a large variance in how much we feel we have to say about ourselves depending on who we are talking to. Some people make us feel boring, while others draw out our stories and observations. This happens because our unconscious minds are continuously evaluating how much the other person understands, appreciates, and can accept about what we are saying. Based on this, we conclude how much of ourselves we can safely reveal. People who make us feel we have a lot to say open many rooms in their own minds. They have explored complex, sad, dark, or potentially shameful parts of themselves. By being at ease with these things internally, they signal they will be at ease hearing about those things from others as well. We can become more interesting to others by traveling widely within our own psyches, opening doors to parts of ourselves we usually keep hidden. This shows others we will be a safe, receptive audience for their observations and stories too. By saying a lot to ourselves internally, we ready ourselves to have much to say in conversation with others.

It‚Äôs probably one of my top three values, but it‚Äôs a different definition of freedom. My old definition was freedom to, freedom to do anything I want. Freedom to do whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like. Now I would say that the freedom that I‚Äôm looking for is internal freedom. It‚Äôs freedom from. It‚Äôs freedom from reaction. It‚Äôs freedom from feeling angry. It‚Äôs freedom from being sad. It‚Äôs freedom from being forced to do things.

Why did you spill the coffee? You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. The point is whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out. Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which will happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It&rsquo;s easy to fake it, until you get rattled. So, we have to ask ourselves, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in my cup?&rdquo; When life gets tough, what spills out? Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility? Or does anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions come out? You choose! Today let&rsquo;s work towards filling our cups with gratitude, giveness, joy, words of affirmation, kindness, gentleness and love for others.<ul><li>We <a href=https://theprivatetherapyclinic.co.uk/blog/what-projecting-insecurities-look-like/>project our insecurities</a> onto others</li></ul></li><li>The adults will tell you to stop looking for the spark.

The toxins they release after they eat are designed to kill things, like other microbes looking to &ldquo;share&rdquo; the food that the current diners have found.</p><p>Penicillin is the poop of the Penicillium chrysogenum bacteria fungus, released to keep others from sharing the bread P.C. is living on.
