Correctness should not be part of the measurement of independent thinking What independent thinking is not: Original thinking. Reduction in Emotional Capacity (difficult times) causes unability to think independently in turn reduced my ability to focus and diminished my patience It was a clear indication that when it comes to a subject that we care deeply about, we all have the ability to think independently and then make a decision that is right for us. To fully unleash this ability, the key is then to expand our attention, focus, and patience to other domains that are (or subconsciously perceived as) less pressing. Framework of Patience First she would be free of the emotions that come along with such a heated debate. Second, without being overwhelmed, she would be emotionally capable of breaking down such a large and complicated question into units of sub-questions through the simple urge to solve a puzzle. Self compassion if I do not soon find ways to attain equanimity, I would never achieve sustained happiness and success in life Meditation Being more present minded not only allows me to be more efficient, but it also makes me more patient. I am in much less of a hurry all the time and can think things through more clearly. Fear of being judged and worry of being wrong have both lessened since I now pay less attention to imaginary feelings in the future. Journaling Time allocation in the day. We are what we do regularly. Thus, monitoring how we spend our time on a daily basis is critical. A review at the end of the day gives us a chance to assess our use of the most limited resource and make changes accordingly; Emotional state of the day. Keeping a record of how my emotions fluctuate allows me to catch red flags of a bad emotional trend earlier; and Investment related ideas and learnings. In terms of the medium of taking notes, I find it easiest to do my journaling digitally. I have been using the app Day One, which I think does the job very well. Elder siblings have to deal with inexperienced parents, they learn a lot in the process. If you feel resistance before you begin, it‚Äôs usually procrastination and you need to get started.\nIf you feel resistance after you begin, it‚Äôs usually feedback and you need to make adjustments.

Why did you spill the coffee? You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. The point is whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out. Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which will happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It‚Äôs easy to fake it, until you get rattled. So, we have to ask ourselves, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in my cup?‚Äù When life gets tough, what spills out? Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility? Or does anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions come out? You choose!

Yes, but eating some bacteria isn‚Äôt what hurts you. Your stomach handles bacteria every day, surfaces are covered with them. However, when bacteria and fungi have been growing for a while on food, they‚Äôve eaten some of it and, well, pooped. The toxins they release after they eat are designed to kill things, like other microbes looking to ‚Äúshare‚Äù the food that the current diners have found.\nPenicillin is the poop of the Penicillium chrysogenum bacteria fungus, released to keep others from sharing the bread P.C. is living on.

Employees came before customers and all other constituents. Everything we did internally was focused on our core values of positive, self-starting, and supportive. The ultimate reason we succeeded was because of our people. In the Path of Revenue ‚Äì Our product unequivocally helped our customers make more money. We showed return on investment. We showed value. Our product helped turn marketing from a fuzzy role to a metrics-driven role. Must-Have Product ‚Äì Our product was the core of the majority of the B2B marketing functions. If you ripped it out, many of the marketing channels stopped working (email, lead forms, etc.). It was not a nice-to-have. Complementary Co-Founders ‚Äì Adam and I are very different yet complemented each other incredibly well. We knew our strengths and weaknesses and built an awesome organization. Focused Solution ‚Äì Our product delivered the most value with the best experience possible at the $1,000/month price point. We were focused on providing the most bang-for-your-buck in the SMB market, and we executed well. This was especially important as our market was so noisy. 03/03/2024\nWhy do women have longer hair than men in almost every society Interesting comments: I have noticed that societies in which long hair isn‚Äôt gendered tend to be societies in which male pattern baldness isn‚Äôt as prevalent, particularly in Native American, Pacific Islander, and Aboriginal Australian cultures.\nShorter/less ornate hair for men might be a cultural mechanism for normalizing something they are expecting to go through at some point in their lives. It is interesting how many ‚Äòhigh status‚Äô hair cuts or even head wear either normalize or hide male pattern baldness. From the Jewish skull cap, to the tenser hair cut of monks, across to samurai styles to a laurel wreath that hides male pattern baldness, to ancient Egyptians shaving all their hair but having a ‚Äòyouth lock‚Äô remaining that would also be shaved on adulthood. 27/02/2024\nhttps://trash-guides.info/ https://sonarr.tv/#downloads-linux-archlinux 26/02/2024\nCompare cost of living of any city Alternatives for Docker Desktop podman colima 12/02/2024\n5 most used architecture patterns Layered architecture Presentation Layer Business Layer Persistence Layer Database Layer Event Driven CQRS Microkernel * Plugins Microservices Monolithic Architecture How to Crack Any System Design Interview Purpose is to assess your ability to Translate an ambiguous problem statement into concrete technical requirements Craft an architecture and design that satisfies those requirements Articulate and defend your design decisions throughout the discussion There is no correct solution, goal is to demonstrate your technical expertise, your approach to problem solving, your sills to communicate effectively Understand Features NFR - Non Functional Requirements Scalability Technical Constraints Important Numbers Use Cases Scoping Deployment Strategies Big Bang Deployment Rolling Deployment Blue Green Deployment Canary Deployment Feature Flags Deployment 11/02/2024\nHow Europe lost Hollywood Germany used to be film capital in world First commercial movie theatre opened in Paris 1895 France and Italy dominated early on California has vast amount of different landscapes and perfect weather conditions (more sun, more lighting) Tech Interview Handbook 10/02/2024\nHuberman podcast - science of love, desire, attachment men find women‚Äôs odour more attractive and women find men more attractive - in pre ovulatory phase of women‚Äôs menstrual cycle Jewelbox - Lab grown diamonds Startup at Shark Tank Season 3 Lab grown diamonds are diamonds but artificially made Codeium Alternate to Github Copilot, claims to be better Gemini - Google Bard‚Äôs next version Alternate to Chatgpt Acko \u003c\u003e Ola Insurance - Golden Peacock Award - old news 09/02/2024\nwhat attracts men to women Her looks catch my attention, her personality is what gets me to stay Second to looks is femininity.

Actually there is one more thing‚Ä¶being really into materialistic shit. In the great words or Tyler Durden ‚Äúthe things you own end up owning you‚Äù. Automate boring parts of your job using robotic process automation (RPA) Men Clothing Brand - XY XX Secrets of successful relationship Pick someone you feel profoundly grateful ever decided to look your way. Start from a sense that you are the lucky one, and they are superior, truth is irrelevant. Make sure you fancy them intimately. Allow yourselves both to admit from an early stage that you are ‚Äòmad‚Äô, heavily distorted by your past, unable to understand yourseleves. Make apology the most regular of occurrences. Remove all pride from your character. Regularly explore how you have disappointed one another. Let them sometimes hate you, and you them. Never describe them categorically as this or that. (i.e. ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre being unfair‚Äù, not ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being unfair‚Äù) Get good at sensing the fear beneath your angry moods, then express the fear gently rather than acting out the anger. Reduce expectations of perfection. Accept you will have crushes on others. If there are children, recognize that love will suffer hugely. Become the sort of person who has no embarrassment about being ‚Äòneedy‚Äô. Read up about attachment theory. Stop being defensive. Accept that they can‚Äôt save you from your own disturbances. Don‚Äôt expect everything from love. Be very prepared (though reluctant) to leave. 06/02/2024\nBecome a more interesting person There is a large variance in how much we feel we have to say about ourselves depending on who we are talking to. Some people make us feel boring, while others draw out our stories and observations. This happens because our unconscious minds are continuously evaluating how much the other person understands, appreciates, and can accept about what we are saying. Based on this, we conclude how much of ourselves we can safely reveal. People who make us feel we have a lot to say open many rooms in their own minds. They have explored complex, sad, dark, or potentially shameful parts of themselves. By being at ease with these things internally, they signal they will be at ease hearing about those things from others as well. We can become more interesting to others by traveling widely within our own psyches, opening doors to parts of ourselves we usually keep hidden. This shows others we will be a safe, receptive audience for their observations and stories too. By saying a lot to ourselves internally, we ready ourselves to have much to say in conversation with others. Self-examination builds capacity for intimacy. 04/02/2024\nT2 BLR Airport - Making Paytm - RBI Case Study 02/02/2024\nStory of Adani Caffeine enslaved the world Caffeine in soft drinks, energy drinks, everywhere Disney hotstar captures one billion emojis 20/01/2024\nGambling laws and fantasy apps in India Minimalism in life - a stoic take GIFT city Gujarat - whats different Malayalam movies and realism India cracking on coaching industries 14/01/2024\nMaking conversation exciting The false completion technique Accept bids for connection (double downs on the joke + laugh) Add touch during conversational highpoints Friendly teasing (Use teases that are obviously not true, tease yourself too) Act out your characters (While telling a story) Pause when you hear laughter (When telling a story) Take a 3 second punchline joke (When telling a story) Have a go to story to tell everyone Paradox fo being nice 12/01/2024\nHow do you split bills Prenups are not valid in India 06/01/2024\nHusn by Anuv Jain - lyrics breakdown what a song fan vs bhakt - fan culture not harmful to pop knuckles but the position when popping knuckles is harmful blr metros Naval on the knowledge project If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre probably afraid of commitment for fear of losing your freedom. The freedom of doing anything, of going anywhere, of being with anyone.\nIn one simple sentence he changed everything I thought I knew. Here‚Äôs the quote:\nI would say that the biggest such change was when I was younger, I really, really valued freedom. Freedom was one of my core, core values. Ironically, it still is. It‚Äôs probably one of my top three values, but it‚Äôs a different definition of freedom. My old definition was freedom to, freedom to do anything I want. Freedom to do whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like. Now I would say that the freedom that I‚Äôm looking for is internal freedom. It‚Äôs freedom from. It‚Äôs freedom from reaction. It‚Äôs freedom from feeling angry. It‚Äôs freedom from being sad. It‚Äôs freedom from being forced to do things. I‚Äôm looking for freedom from internally and externally, whereas before I was looking for freedom to.\n02/01/2024\nhttps://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/anapanasati.pdf ","wordCount":"4635","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-01T22:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2024-12-19T14:59:31.443217805+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wilspi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wilspi.com/link-log/2024/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"wilspi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wilspi.com/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wilspi.com accesskey=h title="wilspi (Alt + H)">wilspi</a>

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdS2MX9i1eo">Mark Manson on paradox of self awareness</a>
* Self awareness - good for underperformers (under stress/anxiety) , bad for who are already doing good
* Therapy - good tool but frameworks like CBT etc. are all same, they are means to get you into a place where your thoughts and feelings can be critically analysed
* You can even talk with your friend, no therapy is required
* Or even journaling can help (much better way)
* Consciousness - Arthur Schopenhauer
* Involves two things
* Subject - observer
* generally, we are the subject of our consciousness
* Object - whatever is observed
* our thoughts or objects
* When object is external, my impulses/thoughts etc - as a whole becomes &ldquo;I&rdquo;, this unexamined subject is often referred as the ego
* When we turn the focus on ourselves (thoughts and feelings become the object ie internal) we are able to differentiate and put them into perspective
* Self Awareness and Self Delusion
* False Memory Syndrome
* In todays age, folks are more self aware yet mentally not healthy
* Self awareness is normalising the pathology and not pathologizing the normal
* Advices
* stop seeing discomfort or challenges as something to be solved or fixed.
* anxiety, anger etc are all feedback - you dont always have to take the feedback
* dont fix whats broken
* get some physical activity</p></li><li><p>21/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay1yDyc8Rok">Warfare with Drones</a></li><li><a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/IND/?category=forest-change&amp;location=WyJjb3VudHJ5IiwiSU5EIl0%3D">Deforestation in India - From 2002 to 2023, India lost 414 kha of humid primary forest</a></li></ul></li><li><p>18/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq46-UCWuZ4">First 100 days - depression, anxiety</a></li></ul></li><li><p>15/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0UQgrFNExc">Old-rich wear sober, new-rich wear flashy brands</a></li></ul></li><li><p>12/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFc3k1b8844">Interview with documentary creators - Samdish</a></li></ul></li><li><p>08/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaS-iVwaOLw">Fast Fashion</a><ul><li>Fast Fashion is very cheap and trendy<ul><li>People buy lots but don&rsquo;t wear them often</li><li>Poor in quality</li></ul></li><li>big contributor to pollution -> generates too much waste</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>07/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsLaI4jDftA">Game theory tactics</a><ul><li>Sunk Cost Fallacy</li><li>Zero Sum Game: Minimax Strategy</li><li>Mutual Cooperation - not all games are zero sum games</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7k08t2pD3E">BJP - Washing Machine</a><ul><li>Adarsh Housing Society Scam - Ashok Chavan</li><li>Narda News &lt;> Bribe - Suvendu Adhikari</li><li>Mulayam Singh Yadav Income tax theft - CBI case 2007</li><li>CBI and ED - chief are appointed by government (directly or indirectly)</li><li>Elections aer costly, after winning they try to recover the money</li><li>Politicians dont have any ideology, they just want to win and earn money and status</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>06/04/2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM">Game Theory - Strategies that work in real life</a><ul><li><a href=/n/game-theory>game theory</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://premium.capitalmind.in/2024/04/focused-fy24-review/>Investing strategy by Capitalmind - Four Quadrant Framework</a></li><li><a href=https://desilorance.substack.com/p/thinking-independently-about-independent>Independent thinking</a><ul><li>Independent thinking has long been associated with &ldquo;Thinking based on <a href=/n/first-principle-thinking>first principle</a>&rdquo;</li><li>Independent thinking need not necessarily mean being correct<ul><li>One just needs to be logical.

Why did you spill the coffee? You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. The point is whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out. Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which will happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It&rsquo;s easy to fake it, until you get rattled. So, we have to ask ourselves, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in my cup?&rdquo; When life gets tough, what spills out? Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility? Or does anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions come out? You choose! Today let&rsquo;s work towards filling our cups with gratitude, giveness, joy, words of affirmation, kindness, gentleness and love for others.<ul><li>We <a href=https://theprivatetherapyclinic.co.uk/blog/what-projecting-insecurities-look-like/>project our insecurities</a> onto others</li></ul></li><li>The adults will tell you to stop looking for the spark.

Your stomach handles bacteria every day, surfaces are covered with them. However, when bacteria and fungi have been growing for a while on food, they&rsquo;ve eaten some of it and, well, pooped. The toxins they release after they eat are designed to kill things, like other microbes looking to &ldquo;share&rdquo; the food that the current diners have found.</p><p>Penicillin is the poop of the Penicillium chrysogenum bacteria fungus, released to keep others from sharing the bread P.C. is living on.
