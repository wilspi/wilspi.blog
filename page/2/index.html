Whenever we are hurt/harmed or have been at the end of an unsatisfying or unfavourable situation, we replay the situation and try to judge each and every action, of ourselves and of others. We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.

Face the conflict and pro-actively seek to understand what lies at its root. An enemy or adversary is someone who seeks to do you harm.
