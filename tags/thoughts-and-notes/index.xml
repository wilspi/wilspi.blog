Sigmund Freud&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Ego and the Id&amp;rdquo; (1923) formulates the structural personality model in which he articulates a map of the different layers which comprise the human soul: the conscious, unconscious and preconscious which correlate with the faculties of ego, id and super-ego.
