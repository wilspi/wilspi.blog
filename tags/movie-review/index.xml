      <description>So, Batman got released this week and it was a delight to watch.
Matt Reeves&amp;rsquo;s Batman Thoughts:
  The casting was perfect, especially Colin Farrell (as Penguin), Paul Dano (as Riddler) and Robert Pattinson (as Batman) did wonderful job.
  Film was a noir detective thriller. It didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on Batman but explored his detective journey.
  The part where it shows that the parents were not perfect, it creates a conflict inside batman     I am vengeance, Matt Reeves say a lot without saying it   The Batman was more realistic than ever, be it black eye makeup, or the police chase sequence, or the gadget and tech support, only high end tech (far-fetched) I remember was the eye nanocam.</description>
