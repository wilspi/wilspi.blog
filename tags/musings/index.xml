We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.
This is one way to analyse such a situation and find ways to move forward.
What is &amp;ldquo;Intention Vs Impact&amp;rdquo;? Whenever we are hurt by the other person&amp;rsquo;s action, and we try to confront the other person, they often don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge the harm happened.</description></item><item><title>Cheatsheet for life ‚úçÔ∏è</title><link>https://wilspi.com/my/mantras/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/my/mantras/</guid><description>You You are unique ü´∂ Believe in yourself Leave every place/relationship (even family) that doesn&amp;rsquo;t value you. Love yourself. Believe in yourself. &amp;ldquo;Be gentle with yourself; show yourself the same kindness and patience you might show a young child - the child you once were.

Alcohol is considered bad because it causes one to lose control over senses. Anything that causes one to lose control over their senses is bad.
Golden rule of partying. One party Two Drinks Main purpose is Socialising. It‚Äôs a platform to meet people and make new friends not to get drunk. The loss of bodily control that comes with alcohol or drugs is fun. Do it, but within the confines of a controlled, safe environment where you are not likely to do anything you&amp;rsquo;ll regret when you have regained control.</description></item><item><title>shower-thoughts ü§î</title><link>https://wilspi.com/my/shower-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/my/shower-thoughts/</guid><description>2024-01-28
People mirror you, if you put out strong opinions, they do too. Does this happen when people like you? they mirror you? In a way, yes, they want to prove themselves in the eyes of the opposite person. They do that. Dating on apps is like doing crowdwork, asking what you do, why is a horse in your photo etc. ~2024

&amp;ldquo;The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love.
It may look paradoxical to you, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person&amp;ndash;without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.</description></item></channel></rss>
