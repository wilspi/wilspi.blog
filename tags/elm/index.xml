      <description>In this post I will be creating a small game, 2048 in Elm. 2048 is a game created by gabrielecirulli which went viral in 2014.
I chose 2048 because the game mechanics are simple which will help us understand Elm clearly. Also, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make another todo app.
You can play here.
The Game Mechanics?  There are some number tiles on the board (4x4). The number on the tile will be a power of 2 with minimum being 2.</description>
