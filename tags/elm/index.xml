      <description>During my stint at Acko, we were using Elm in parts of our codebase but I never got the chance to extensively work on any Elm project. I was intrigued with the language (optimized for developer&amp;rsquo;s happiness, they say), and so I decided to try it out. To validate my learning, I decided to build a simple app, but not another TODO app.
Here comes: 2048
2048 Game 2048 is a game created by gabrielecirulli which went viral in 2014.</description>
