Cook me Feedback To have a better food experience with your cook, you have to constantly tell him about your likes and dislikes. Sometimes he/she might cook you a fantastic dinner (something new) and never know if you liked.
Whatsapp is good for chatting but not remembering, also your food habits are not structured and easily accessible within whatsapp and other note taking platforms.</description>
