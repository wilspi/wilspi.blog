not by choice - shyness, low self esteem etc. if this is the cause, it needs to be worked on. by choice - for example schizoid personality or typical case where one doesnt find most people &amp;lsquo;interesting enough&amp;rsquo;. these people can talk with interesting people for hours but on average are not talkative. this is okay, we dont need to disorderize this. Introvert - Extrovert is a spectrum.</description></item></channel></rss>
