      <description>This is in DRAFT mode.
Pointer is a general concept in Computer Programming for a variable that stores memory address. In Rust, generally we use references to access the value stored at a memory address. References are simple pointers, that work within the limits of Rust&amp;rsquo;s ownership and borrowing concept. Lets look at other types which go beyond these limits.
Note: These are quick short notes, if you want to look in deep check out rustlang docs.</description>
