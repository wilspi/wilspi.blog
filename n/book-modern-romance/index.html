It was about creating conditions that made it possible to survive and reproduce.\n“Marriage was too vital an economic and political institution to be entered into solely on the basis of something as irrational as love” Women wanted financial security. Men wanted virginity and weren’t concerned with deeper qualities like education or intelligence. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide The older folks weren’t buying it. They understood that they had had fewer options when they were growing up, but, intriguingly, they didn’t seem to regret having fewer choices. As one woman explained, “You didn’t think about the choices you had. When you found someone you liked, you jumped into a relationship. I don’t think we thought, Well, there are another twelve doors or another seventeen doors or another four hundred and thirty-three doors,” she said. “We saw a door we wanted, and so we took it.”\nToday we want a bunch of doors as options and we are very cautious about which one we open.
