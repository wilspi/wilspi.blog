Don‚Äôt be snarky. Avoid using derogatory language or making personal attacks. Please don‚Äôt fulminate. Please don‚Äôt sneer, including at the rest of the community. Listen first:\nTake the time to listen to others before sharing your own thoughts or opinions. This can help you better understand the perspectives of others and build stronger relationships. Follow the rules:\nEvery community has its own set of guidelines and rules that participants are expected to follow. Make sure you understand and respect these rules. Contribute value:\nEngage in discussions in a way that adds value to the community. Share your expertise, experiences, and insights, and avoid being overly self-promotional or spammy. Have curious conversation; don‚Äôt cross-examine. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive. When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that‚Äôs easier to criticize. Assume good faith. Avoid generic tangents. Omit internet tropes. A good critical comment teaches us something, folks should learn something new from the discussions. Please don‚Äôt carry too far political or ideological battle. It tramples curiosity. Please don‚Äôt pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about in the thread. Find something interesting to respond to instead. Please don‚Äôt complain about tangential annoyances ‚Äî things like article or website formats. They‚Äôre too common to be interesting. Please don‚Äôt post shallow dismissals. Be open-minded:\nBe open to learning from others and being challenged on your own beliefs and assumptions. This can help you grow as an individual and build stronger relationships within the community. Give back:\nOffer help, support, and resources to others in the community when you can. This can help build a stronger sense of community and create a positive feedback loop of giving and receiving. Overall, the key to effectively engaging in a community is to be respectful, listen actively, and contribute value in a way that aligns with the community‚Äôs values and guidelines.\n","wordCount":"479","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://wilspi.com/images/community-cover.webp","datePublished":"2022-10-22T22:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2022-10-22T22:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wilspi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wilspi.com/n/rules-of-engagement/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"wilspi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wilspi.com/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wilspi.com accesskey=h title="wilspi (Alt + H)">wilspi</a>
