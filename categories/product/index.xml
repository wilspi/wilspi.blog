      <description>This is an idea for an utility application for avid book readers, favoring mobile platform.
Often times in a library when we are searching for a book, we have to scan and go through each and every book&amp;rsquo;s title or author. This exercise is tough and draining. The pain goes multi fold when you are looking for multiple books or authors. Now imagine you have an app which scans and reads every book names, while you hold the mobile camera and stroll in the library, and the app flickers the screen to alert you that it found one of the books you were looking for.</description>
