      <description>From Django&amp;rsquo;s context:
 Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django’s request/response processing.
It’s a light, low-level “plugin” system for globally altering Django’s input or output.
 Middleware is like a layer which processes every request and response. Instead of logging requests and responses in resp. views, its better to do at middleware level which will log every request.
Here, we are using Django&amp;rsquo;s middleware semantics to construct a middleware which will log all requests and corresponding responses.</description>

      <description>Quick nginx hack to save your production web server in case the web service starts crashing.
If you have been working in production environment, you know at certain times your web service can crash due to some unknown reason. It will take some time to do the RCA and fix the issue. A quick hack is to have multiple web services running on different ports resp. that can take the load off, if any of them goes down.</description>
