You don‚Äôt cherish the relation but these special moments of togetherness. A great way, to start a friendship with someone, is to do something together. We see our photos differently, with the emotions, with the memories, they hold. These photos could be Instagram-my or cringey but are beautiful in our heads. People see just the image but we see a complete world, the world we lived in. It is a snapshot of our world, of our memories.\nNo matter how flawed your workplace be or how much vengeance/envy you hold against it, you always want it to be as successful as it can be, even if you don‚Äôt hold any profit/shares in it, why? it‚Äôs a non-zero sum-game, think of it as holding a medal which goes on your resume\nIt‚Äôs not the future you are afraid of, it‚Äôs the fear of the past repeating itself that haunts you\nOur world is built upon the idea of protecting and supporting the weak. Gov. provides basic healthcare, education to everyone. And if you are self-sustainable, the sky is the limit for you. The same happens in Corporates, there are proper systems/channels to support the weak employee and to push him morally, emotionally, to enable him/her to contribute in better form. But often there are no differential perks in the system for those who already do better, no growth channel for them, they are all ranked equally, maybe the ‚Äúexceeds expectation‚Äù bucket.\n[Amitu Discussion] Humans are the most trusting species (or that is how we have been conditioned?). We trust that the person, walking next to us, won‚Äôt kill us. We are conditioned to feel safe that way.\nThe first impression of any art (movie/painting/book/article) or art-form or perspective for that matter, is uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing, and we never see the intelligence behind the world which got created. We are rejectful of the idea because we can‚Äôt comprehend it. It takes time and more similar experiences to see the depth, understand, and appreciate the craft. Weak opinion.\nCats demand love, dogs earn it. Cheesy, huh.\n#timeline knows more buttered truths, while #savedraft knows more bitter truths\nProbably, a clich√©. Life is a video game.\nIf you lose a round, you can always hit reset and restart the level. If you win, well, get ready because there‚Äôs always a tougher monster waiting for you on the next level. You have to sharpen your blades to kill the next monster and level up. And remember, you‚Äôre the one holding the controller, so you‚Äôre in control of your destiny. An outlook in Chess\nIn Chess, what‚Äôs the primary goal for each piece? Naturally, the ultimate goal is to ensure your king‚Äôs survival while aiming to checkmate the opponent‚Äôs king. But what to do in the meantime? You advance your pawns forward; their objective is to reach the opponent‚Äôs fortress and loot it up to ascend to the rank of queen or minister. Meanwhile, the other pieces (non pawns) work to support the pawns in every conceivable manner. On the flip side, the opponent‚Äôs pieces strive to resist and ensure their own pawns have the same opportunity. Sartaj, a character from Sacred Games, is yet another employee of the system (nothing special). However, as we witness the story unfold from his perspective, experiencing his struggles and witnessing his fighting spirit, he ultimately emerges as the hero of the narrative.\nThe world is a collection of all of our realities. The reality of a person that holds greater strength becomes predominant, and we all naturally accept it. Moreover, our reality is shaped by our actions. Since actions are irrefutable, they reinforce the strength of our reality. Simplicity should be the measure for everything.\nIf it is simple, it might be the best, but if it is not simple, it is definitely not the best. Fanciness attracts but has low binding power. Money is the universal metric for grading statuses, ideologies.\nOne‚Äôs philosophy starts getting noticed when it works for them, when results are born out those philosophies and results are measures in capital (in today‚Äôs era). The hero shoulders the unspoken duty of uplifting the weaker members. Community development doesn‚Äôt occur by merely improving the average, the average is a statistical concept, not the right measure in this context. Elevate the standards (the upper bar), and the average will naturally follow suit.\nTo become something, start doing what the person in the role is supposed to do, take up their responsibility, fake till you make it. Owning something means you are in ways attached to the object, and it‚Äôs natural for us to desire ownership (isn‚Äôt it?).\nIn our professional lives, we take ownership of responsibilities and roles, which fosters a sense of connection to our work. Similarly, we take ownership of our perspectives and viewpoints, leading to a strong attachment to our opinions. It could also be the other way round, that we crave attachments, we yearn to claim something as our own, whether it‚Äôs family, home, work, even a social media profile. Sacrifices in old rituals actually teach us to give up on our attachments.\nAuthority should always be there on paper only. Freedom is all anyone ever want. To speak. To work. To play. To celebrate. To innovate. An advice for leaders and parents.\nOur present version is always the best version compared with any of our previous versions (with respect to time, let‚Äôs say compared with yesterday‚Äôs version of myself).\nWhat is the basis of this comparison? Basis Evolution. We always think that we used to be better in xyz field, but we don‚Äôt realise that we have evolved. And if we are alive, that evolution did work out for us. Judge basis action, punish basis intention? - intention vs action\nWhen do you have your own voice?\nI suppose one way to look at this is when you start making your own processes, they will be inspired by others but your processes mean you have tweaked them for yourself. You have started to know yourself, what works for you and what not. Why do we get annoyed in relationships? It‚Äôs usually when we want to express our feelings/desires, but we worry the other person won‚Äôt get it. So, we suppress our thoughts and keep it to ourselves, but those feelings have to come out somehow, right? So, they bubble up in other ways, and that‚Äôs when irritation kicks in\nReading horoscopes and sun-signs feel good because they all give us validations. And we seek them.\nWhen life is steady, rain feels like a joy. But when you‚Äôre stressed or struggling to make ends meet, rain can seem like an obstacle, a halt in your plans.\nWhenever someone asks you to speak in Marathi, you almost always end it with ‚ÄúJai Maharashtra‚Äù, does this happen with other languages as well?\n","wordCount":"1590","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-04-07T21:00:27.666967747+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wilspi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wilspi.com/my/shower-thoughts/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"wilspi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wilspi.com/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wilspi.com accesskey=h title="wilspi (Alt + H)">wilspi</a>
