It‚Äôs a platform to meet people and make new friends not to get drunk. The loss of bodily control that comes with alcohol or drugs is fun. Do it, but within the confines of a controlled, safe environment where you are not likely to do anything you‚Äôll regret when you have regained control. Guilty pleasures\nBitching I know we shouldn‚Äôt but it feels good to vent out It should be done only for the purpose of venting out, not harming anyone‚Äôs reputation It should be done only with members of your closed circle Gossiping Its a waste of time but again it feels good sometimes How is gossiping different from bitching?
