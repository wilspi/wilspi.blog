Anything that causes one to lose control over their senses is bad.\nGolden rule of partying: One party, Two Drinks Main purpose is Socialising. It‚Äôs a platform to meet people and make new friends, not to get drunk. The loss of bodily control that comes with alcohol or drugs is fun. Do it, but within the confines of a controlled, safe environment where you are not likely to do anything you‚Äôll regret, when you have regained control.

No. Say God doesn‚Äôt exist, then my belief is just a belief, it doesn‚Äôt change anything. The existence of God or the idea of God is to give us hope and strength in times of despair give us a moral compass give us a sense of community Shower Thoughts These are musings, random weird first draft thoughts.\n~2024\nAlways get a crash introduction before going into something new and major, so you are prepared (so it doesn‚Äôt get spoiled) and it will make the experience worthwhile. Say for treks, or college life, or a new job, or a new city, or a new relationship. Impress a smart person by beating his/her intellect or questioning him/her, smart people like bold people Psychologically why do we enjoy the company of funny people? Is it because they tend to be secure and bold enough to face potential humiliation? Also, comedy often has an edge that can offend someone, as humor frequently comes at the expense of others. Chatgpt Baba: Great question! Liking a funny person goes beyond just enjoying their jokes; it taps into deeper psychological factors: Perceived Social Intelligence: Funny people often exhibit high social intelligence. Their ability to read a room and respond with humor signals to us that they are aware and empathetic, which makes them more likable. Charm and Charisma: Humor often comes with a charismatic personality. Funny individuals tend to be more animated and engaging, making interactions feel more dynamic and enjoyable. Disarming Tension: A funny person can lighten serious situations, making them feel safer and more approachable. This ability to diffuse tension can lead us to trust and like them more. Shared Values and Experiences: Humor often reflects shared cultural or personal experiences. When a funny person makes us laugh about something relatable, it fosters a sense of connection and mutual understanding. Positive Reinforcement: Being around someone funny can create a cycle of positive reinforcement. If we enjoy their company, we seek them out more, which in turn reinforces our feelings of liking them. Unique Perspective: Funny people often offer fresh perspectives on life, which can be refreshing and thought-provoking. This uniqueness can make them stand out and draw us to them. Vulnerability and Authenticity: Many funny individuals share their own quirks and flaws through humor, making them feel more relatable and authentic. This vulnerability can deepen our connection with them. In essence, we are drawn to funny people not just for their ability to make us laugh but also for the warmth, connection, and positive feelings they evoke in us. What if your partner is mute or deaf or somehow physically disabled?

To some extent, yes. They may seek to validate themselves in your eyes, thus emulating your actions. Dating on apps is like doing crowd-work, asking what you do, why is a horse in your photo etc.\nGenerally, anything mainstream is saturated (overrated)\nIn the field of entertainment, the entertaining value of the mainstream content is saturated, either it has become cringe or boring ~2023\nWhitewash Image - PR masterstroke - Start the anti-bullying campaign to cover up being the bully in the past. As a result, if you google ‚Äú bully‚Äù numerous articles of anti-bullying campaign shall popup. Attractive people sell better, hence in movies/tv-series better looking folks are preferred over better actors.\nI come from the India where a Hindu has to prove his secularism and a Muslim has to prove his nationalism constantly.\nCourt sessions are based on proofs and laws (not logic), movies are based on invoking emotions (not logic) - logic is only a tool\nHer looks catch my attention, her personality is what gets me to stay\n~2022\n‚ÄúSave for Later‚Äù - Are we becoming collective procrastinators?\nSave this article for later -\u003e Pockets, One-tab, Reddit-save, Twitter-Bookmark, all these apps/features are building procrastination in us. How many of us go back to that saved thread or article?\nDrug - You are never content, no matter how many times, no matter how high. It‚Äôs en endless chase in the most literal sense of the term.\nPop culture is mostly an event-driven system, recently The Social Dilemma was so huge and now it is completely gone. Avoid things that come in pop culture. They dont stay, dont invest in it. Its okay to not be part of the pop group.\nArt - Art na lage woh bhut high quality art hai, jo script script na dikhe woh bhut achii script hai\nMost of the youtubers are wannabes, trying to become cool (previously tiktokers), they are just supplying cringe\nSounding profound has become a gimmick these days. everyone wants to build a community, its good you want to grow but please practice before you preach\nHaving a normal routine life is tough. There are so many hurdles, you are constantly trying to not fall down by these hurdles. It is so tough and rewarding at the same time.\n2018-2021\nIndian traffic behaves how sediments behave in the water, gravitationally pulled towards the signal.\nSpecial moments of our lives can be ‚Äúdescribed‚Äù, but can‚Äôt be ‚Äúfelt‚Äù by others.\nBonding happens when you share these ‚Äútogether moments‚Äù, it is about the feeling which is shared. You don‚Äôt cherish the relation but these special moments of togetherness. A great way, to start a friendship with someone, is to do something together. We see our photos differently, with the emotions, with the memories, they hold. These photos could be Instagram-my or cringey but are beautiful in our heads. People see just the image but we see a complete world, the world we lived in. It is a snapshot of our world, of our memories.\nNo matter how flawed your workplace be or how much vengeance/envy you hold against it, you always want it to be as successful as it can be, even if you don‚Äôt hold any profit/shares in it, why? it‚Äôs a non-zero sum-game, think of it as holding a medal which goes on your resume\nIt‚Äôs not the future you are afraid of, it‚Äôs the fear of the past repeating itself that haunts you\nOur world is built upon the idea of protecting and supporting the weak. Gov. provides basic healthcare, education to everyone. And if you are self-sustainable, the sky is the limit for you. The same happens in Corporates, there are proper systems/channels to support the weak employee and to push him morally, emotionally, to enable him/her to contribute in better form. But often there are no differential perks in the system for those who already do better, no growth channel for them, they are all ranked equally, maybe the ‚Äúexceeds expectation‚Äù bucket.\n[Amitu Discussion] Humans are the most trusting species (or that is how we have been conditioned?). We trust that the person, walking next to us, won‚Äôt kill us. We are conditioned to feel safe that way.\nThe first impression of any art (movie/painting/book/article) or art-form or perspective for that matter, is uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing, and we never see the intelligence behind the world which got created. We are rejectful of the idea because we can‚Äôt comprehend it. It takes time and more similar experiences to see the depth, understand, and appreciate the craft. Weak opinion.\nCats demand love, dogs earn it. Cheesy, huh.\n#timeline knows more buttered truths, while #savedraft knows more bitter truths\nProbably, a clich√©. Life is a video game.\nIf you lose a round, you can always hit reset and restart the level. If you win, well, get ready because there‚Äôs always a tougher monster waiting for you on the next level. You have to sharpen your blades to kill the next monster and level up. And remember, you‚Äôre the one holding the controller, so you‚Äôre in control of your destiny. An outlook in Chess\nIn Chess, what‚Äôs the primary goal for each piece? Naturally, the ultimate goal is to ensure your king‚Äôs survival while aiming to checkmate the opponent‚Äôs king. But what to do in the meantime? You advance your pawns forward; their objective is to reach the opponent‚Äôs fortress and loot it up to ascend to the rank of queen or minister. Meanwhile, the other pieces (non pawns) work to support the pawns in every conceivable manner. On the flip side, the opponent‚Äôs pieces strive to resist and ensure their own pawns have the same opportunity. Sartaj, a character from Sacred Games, is yet another employee of the system (nothing special). However, as we witness the story unfold from his perspective, experiencing his struggles and witnessing his fighting spirit, he ultimately emerges as the hero of the narrative.\nThe world is a collection of all of our realities. The reality of a person that holds greater strength becomes predominant, and we all naturally accept it. Moreover, our reality is shaped by our actions. Since actions are irrefutable, they reinforce the strength of our reality. Simplicity should be the measure for everything.\nIf it is simple, it might be the best, but if it is not simple, it is definitely not the best. Fanciness attracts but has low binding power. Money is the universal metric for grading statuses, ideologies.\nOne‚Äôs philosophy starts getting noticed when it works for them, when results are born out those philosophies and results are measures in capital (in today‚Äôs era). The hero shoulders the unspoken duty of uplifting the weaker members. Community development doesn‚Äôt occur by merely improving the average, the average is a statistical concept, not the right measure in this context. Elevate the standards (the upper bar), and the average will naturally follow suit.\nTo become something, start doing what the person in the role is supposed to do, take up their responsibility, fake till you make it. Owning something means you are in ways attached to the object, and it‚Äôs natural for us to desire ownership (isn‚Äôt it?).\nIn our professional lives, we take ownership of responsibilities and roles, which fosters a sense of connection to our work. Similarly, we take ownership of our perspectives and viewpoints, leading to a strong attachment to our opinions. It could also be the other way round, that we crave attachments, we yearn to claim something as our own, whether it‚Äôs family, home, work, even a social media profile. Sacrifices in old rituals actually teach us to give up on our attachments.\nAuthority should always be there on paper only. Freedom is all anyone ever want. To speak. To work. To play. To celebrate. To innovate. An advice for leaders and parents.\nOur present version is always the best version compared with any of our previous versions (with respect to time, let‚Äôs say compared with yesterday‚Äôs version of myself).\nWhat is the basis of this comparison? Basis Evolution. We always think that we used to be better in xyz field, but we don‚Äôt realise that we have evolved. And if we are alive, that evolution did work out for us. Judge basis action, punish basis intention? - intention vs action\nWhen do you have your own voice?\nI suppose one way to look at this is when you start making your own processes, they will be inspired by others but your processes mean you have tweaked them for yourself. You have started to know yourself, what works for you and what not. Why do we get annoyed in relationships? It‚Äôs usually when we want to express our feelings/desires, but we worry the other person won‚Äôt get it. So, we suppress our thoughts and keep it to ourselves, but those feelings have to come out somehow, right? So, they bubble up in other ways, and that‚Äôs when irritation kicks in\nReading horoscopes and sun-signs feel good because they all give us validations. And we seek them.\nWhen life is steady, rain feels like a joy. But when you‚Äôre stressed or struggling to make ends meet, rain can seem like an obstacle, a halt in your plans.\nWhenever someone asks you to speak in Marathi, you almost always end it with ‚ÄúJai Maharashtra‚Äù, does this happen with other languages as well?\n","wordCount":"2358","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-10T15:59:09.530029019+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wilspi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wilspi.com/my/thought-journal/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"wilspi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wilspi.com/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wilspi.com accesskey=h title="wilspi (Alt + H)">wilspi</a>

You have to sharpen your blades to kill the next monster and level up.</li><li>And remember, you&rsquo;re the one holding the controller, so you&rsquo;re in control of your destiny.</li></ul></li><li><p>An outlook in Chess</p><ul><li>In Chess, what&rsquo;s the primary goal for each piece? Naturally, the ultimate goal is to ensure your king&rsquo;s survival while aiming to checkmate the opponent&rsquo;s king. But what to do in the meantime? You advance your pawns forward; their objective is to reach the opponent&rsquo;s fortress and loot it up to ascend to the rank of queen or minister. Meanwhile, the other pieces (non pawns) work to support the pawns in every conceivable manner. On the flip side, the opponent&rsquo;s pieces strive to resist and ensure their own pawns have the same opportunity.</li></ul></li><li><p>Sartaj, a character from Sacred Games, is yet another employee of the system (nothing special). However, as we witness the story unfold from his perspective, experiencing his struggles and witnessing his fighting spirit, he ultimately emerges as the hero of the narrative.</p><ul><li>The world is a collection of all of our realities. The reality of a person that holds greater strength becomes predominant, and we all naturally accept it.<ul><li>Moreover, our reality is shaped by our actions. Since actions are irrefutable, they reinforce the strength of our reality.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Simplicity should be the measure for everything.</p><ul><li>If it is simple, it might be the best, but if it is not simple, it is definitely not the best.</li><li>Fanciness attracts but has low binding power.</li></ul></li><li><p>Money is the universal metric for grading statuses, ideologies.</p><ul><li>One&rsquo;s philosophy starts getting noticed when it works for them, when results are born out those philosophies and results are measures in capital (in today&rsquo;s era).</li></ul></li><li><p>The hero shoulders the unspoken duty of uplifting the weaker members. Community development doesn&rsquo;t occur by merely improving the average, the average is a statistical concept, not the right measure in this context. Elevate the standards (the upper bar), and the average will naturally follow suit.</p><ul><li>To become something, start doing what the person in the role is supposed to do, take up their responsibility, fake till you make it.</li></ul></li><li><p>Owning something means you are in ways attached to the object, and it&rsquo;s natural for us to desire ownership (isn&rsquo;t it?).</p><ul><li>In our professional lives, we take ownership of responsibilities and roles, which fosters a sense of connection to our work. Similarly, we take ownership of our perspectives and viewpoints, leading to a strong attachment to our opinions.</li><li>It could also be the other way round, that we crave attachments, we yearn to claim something as our own, whether it&rsquo;s family, home, work, even a social media profile.</li></ul></li><li><p>Sacrifices in old rituals actually teach us to give up on our attachments.</p></li><li><p>Authority should always be there on paper only. Freedom is all anyone ever want. To speak. To work. To play. To celebrate. To innovate. An advice for leaders and parents.</p></li><li><p>Our present version is always the best version compared with any of our previous versions (with respect to time, let&rsquo;s say compared with yesterday&rsquo;s version of myself).</p><ul><li>What is the basis of this comparison? Basis Evolution. We always think that we used to be better in xyz field, but we don&rsquo;t realise that we have evolved. And if we are alive, that evolution did work out for us.</li></ul></li><li><p>Judge basis action, punish basis intention? - <a href=/p/intention-vs-action/>intention vs action</a></p></li><li><p>When do you have your own voice?</p><ul><li>I suppose one way to look at this is when you start making your own processes, they will be inspired by others but your processes mean you have tweaked them for yourself. You have started to know yourself, what works for you and what not.</li></ul></li><li><p>Why do we get annoyed in relationships? It&rsquo;s usually when we want to express our feelings/desires, but we worry the other person won&rsquo;t get it. So, we suppress our thoughts and keep it to ourselves, but those feelings have to come out somehow, right? So, they bubble up in other ways, and that&rsquo;s when irritation kicks in</p></li><li><p>Reading horoscopes and sun-signs feel good because they all give us validations. And we seek them.</p></li><li><p>When life is steady, rain feels like a joy. But when you&rsquo;re stressed or struggling to make ends meet, rain can seem like an obstacle, a halt in your plans.</p></li><li><p>Whenever someone asks you to speak in Marathi, you almost always end it with &ldquo;Jai Maharashtra&rdquo;, does this happen with other languages as well?</p></li></ul></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a
