Believe in yourself.\n‚ÄúBe gentle with yourself; show yourself the same kindness and patience you might show a young child - the child you once were. If you won‚Äôt be your own friend, who will be? If, when playing an opponent, you are also opposing yourself, you will be outnumbered.‚Äù\nSpeak up You are the biggest spokesperson for yourself.\nYour opinion matters. Your opinions are different and you need to embrace them. If you don‚Äôt say what you want, if you don‚Äôt fight for yourself, who else will. You miss out on 100% of things if you don't ask for things/ put forth your opinions. Speaking up brings that probability to 50-50. How to speak up? Keep shit-posting your thesis.\nNo Glory No Story If there is no moment of glory for you, don‚Äôt be in it. Extension of this, don‚Äôt say things that negate your value. You are also the biggest cheerleader of yourself.\nIf you are not sorry don‚Äôt say it. Don‚Äôt demoralise yourself. Don‚Äôt tell stories in which either you are losing or you can be made fun of. Accept it yourself but tell others about it when asked. Avoid negative marketing if you can. You are beautiful If you think you are not perfect, then who is?

It makes you, YOU.\nBody is Armor of your existence You should start to look at your body as something that literally protects your life and existence rather than something that is here to marvel at.\nYour body works so hard that it can pump blood, breathe oxygen, walk, run, jump, digest and feel all without you having to really think too hard about it. Outward appearance is nothing compared to physical health and inner beauty. Sure, being attractive is fun but that is dependent on what current trend is in fashion and there‚Äôs no way we can all keep up with it. Never chase Never chase. If you keep chasing you‚Äôll never attract, don‚Äôt try.\nWhen you love yourself and when you be thankful to your well being, quality people get attracted to you and so does money and opportunities in your life. Don‚Äôt show off -\u003e The basic necessity of showing off is to be wanted, to feel that our existence matters. When I say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt show off‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt show your skills. For every performance there is a stage. Know your stage. Live üèÇ Why so serious? \"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\" ‚Äì Master Oogway\nEverybody knows that they should live in present, but does everybody live?\nWe live in present when we enjoy doing stuff we love. And we don‚Äôt when things don‚Äôt work out our way.\nWhat you were doesn‚Äôt matter, What you are does.\nWhat happened doesn‚Äôt matter, What is happening does.\nSmile, be happy, nothing is permanent, let go. See happiness. Ultimately your willingness to let go of the person you used to be, creates a space for the person you strive to be. Stop weighing yourself against how you think your life is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go and just live it in the way that makes you happy. Life is an adventure not a tick box exercise. Let go of yourself, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù part. You are your experiences and the things you did. Not what your thought you could do or could have done. Be satisfied, being ambitious is okay but be satisfied. You can‚Äôt become the best at everything. ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§¶‡•Å‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§≤‡•å‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ñ‡•ã ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à | See envy Role-play your life, add some salt or some spice, whatever you want, bring some magic to it. ‚ÄúAct out being alive, like a play.

When your stories keep getting repetitive, its a sign your life is becoming dull. Take more risks. The fear of rejection is only temporary. Never ever shy away from new activities/experiences, even if you know you will fail or embarrass yourself. Only crazy stories make the cut. A lot of times you fail due to things out of your control. And you have to learn to be okay with it.\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean you need to stop introspection, but that when things go wrong it is not necessary that you or someone around you could have done something different to make it right. Keep the windows open, a sense of freedom comes from the cold breeze brushing your cheeks and flowing through your hair. See maturity. Self Journey Grow yourself Learn as many skills as possible. Workout, run, go to the gym - keep challenging your body. Socialise Join all sorts of offline groups to socialise more. Do activities that enable socialising - going out for lunch/dinner with colleagues, playing football together, trekking etc. Surround yourself Read books, it expands your mind, open up you to ideas and possibilities it makes you capable to hold conversation about any topics with anybody Love, get your heart broken ‚ÄúYour heart needs to break multiple times for it to open up.‚Äù ‚Äì Rumi Growth has a network effect. You grow with your close ones, their growth will catalyse your growth. Find like minded people to grow. This network effect also has high risk - high growth angle. Growth rate will be higher for a person who is nobody, but has high risk too. Get perspectives ‚ÄúEveryone tells you what‚Äôs good for you. They don‚Äôt want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs.‚Äù ‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior People have their own journey. You can learn from them.

If you think of others getting uneasy or uncomfortable, comfort them, but not at the cost of your self-respect. Think of yourself getting uncomfortable. Never ever let anyone disrespect you. Ever. In front of anyone. Someone‚Äôs expectation is not your responsibility. Any expectation is bound to lead to disappointment, today or tomorrow. You don‚Äôt need to reply to every message/call you get. You need to set priorities and take care of those priorities. If some unknown number gives miss call, don‚Äôt call back. If he/she got some important work he/she will call back. The silence in the conversation or boring response from the other end of the conversation is not your fault. Don‚Äôt hold yourself responsible for having a fantastic conversation. Be the driver Lead your life, lead your relations, don‚Äôt be a passive person. Laid back attitude won‚Äôt get you anywhere. Speak up Self-control is strength. Calmness is mastery. You have to get to a point where your mood doesn‚Äôt shift based on the insignificant actions of someone else. Don‚Äôt allow others to control the direction of your life. Don‚Äôt allow your emotions to overpower your intelligence.

Genius is to know when to stop. Neuroplasticity is a dynamic process that happens constantly with each decision. Every time you check you instagram while trying to study, you are re-enforcing the habit to keep doing it. Every time you focus your entire attention on one single activity at a time, you are making your homing your concentration and dedication. Every time you give in to temptation and at the marshmallow, you are teaching yourself that its okay to break. Be self aware Know why you did what you did, why you are doing what you are doing.

I‚Äôm not saying quit and find a new career, but invest less of your self-esteem in it, because it means nothing and none of the success in it is based on merit.

If you don‚Äôt want someone in your life, or you don‚Äôt want to give them importance, don‚Äôt give them your time, don‚Äôt think/talk about them. See Prioritising yourself.\nInteract within limits Being a good person doesn‚Äôt mean you have to share your every secret (even if the secret is related with the ongoing conversation/discussion). Any information which is meant to stay among very few people, should stay that way. Trust people with the information only if they are directly involved with the agenda. If you are thinking that they are not involved, and hence you can share it with them and get some opinion on the matter. Don‚Äôt do it. This decision will bite you back. Don‚Äôt share all the information you have, share minimum information (required to share - no extra information). Also sometimes they need not to hear the truth, truth (or the observation/analysis) is just for you to understand more about yourself. Never share your story (sad stories, personal thoughts) with anyone or everyone, not everyone is your friend. ‚ÄúNot bitching/gossiping about others‚Äù will add more to your character. Don‚Äôt tell others how you operate Don‚Äôt explain yourself. Don‚Äôt give reasons to anyone but be clear of what you doing and why you doing it. You don‚Äôt explain yourself to shit, you explain yourself to you. Don‚Äôt tell how you behave, how you function to others, let them figure it out. People take advantage of the facts. For example, if someone knows that you have anger issues, they can push you into such a situation (not intentionally, see intent vs impact), or even blame you for some argument where you were not even at fault. Basically it creates a bias, and since it is accepted by you it becomes a strong one. And biases are not good to have with emotional people. Never admit your faults in front of others. Even if you are guilty don‚Äôt acknowledge it to others, understand and admit it to yourself. Carefully judge before admitting it before others, maybe if they also acknowledge errors on their part then do it. If you do it alone, you will alone be blamed for the drama. Understand, most people are insecure and close-minded, they play the ‚Äúpulling down‚Äù game and you have given them a weapon. Conflicts See Conflict Resolution.

Everybody likes to hear praises, even if you don‚Äôt believe it, try to be as genuine as possible. They should face consequences of their bad actions, see intention-vs-action. Genuinely care about them You ask people where they are from, how are they doing and they choose to tell you their important details and you forget It gives the feeling you are a taker, a user. You giving attention because you want something from them Eventually their likeness towards you will turn into dislike Help Constantly ask, ‚ÄúHow can I help‚Äù See networking. Help those in need. Knowledge becomes helpful only when the person is seeking for one. Do not unsettle the minds of the ignorant. To help people, understand where they are coming from, what is the source of their problem. Most of the time they don‚Äôt know the cause, they just know the symptoms. They don‚Äôt want you to tell what is the ideal way to do things. They just want you to help them get going. If you try to give him the ideal/generic solution, the other person won‚Äôt feel comfortable with you, and in future he/she will talk in objectivity (with limited words), or often will try to avoid you. See Prioritising yourself. When life gets boring, helping other people is the best cure for it. Family and Friends You can be replaced at work but not at home. So make sure you take time off from work no matter how much you love it. See Friendship. Relationships Never judge your relationship in the honeymoon phase\nDon‚Äôt allow people to climb over you.
