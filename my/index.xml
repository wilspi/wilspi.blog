It&amp;rsquo;s ok if you only save one person, and it&amp;rsquo;s ok if that person is you.
Leave every place/relationship (even family) that doesn&amp;rsquo;t value you. Love yourself. Believe in yourself.
&amp;ldquo;Be gentle with yourself; show yourself the same kindness and patience you might show a young child - the child you once were.</description></item><item><title>coordinates</title><link>https://wilspi.com/my/coordinates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/my/coordinates/</guid><description>Music Listening Tracker (@Last.fm): https://www.last.fm/user/wilspi

How do I rate the movies? Rating Scale?
Elements? Screenplay Dialogues, Plot, Cinematography
For me I shall believe what the director wants me to believe, I dont want him to explain everything, however, I want him to create consistent characters, inconsistency in characters irks me off.</description></item><item><title>simple pleasures ‚òï</title><link>https://wilspi.com/my/simple-pleasures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/my/simple-pleasures/</guid><description>These simple pleasures are the real luxuries:
Clean Sheets
Coming home and the feeling of getting into bed with clean sheets after the shower Hearing a song that you haven&amp;rsquo;t thought of in a while
First cup of chai in the morning
A hot bath
Going on a walk or ride with soft sun and cool breeze
A good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep
Listening to birds singing
Favourite home cooked meal
Colorful sunsets</description></item><item><title>thought journal ü§î</title><link>https://wilspi.com/my/thought-journal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/my/thought-journal/</guid><description>Opinions As such, many entries in this blog express opinions.
