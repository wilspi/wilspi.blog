That is why it is called the present. – Master Oogway\n​\nUnless someone truly has the power to say no, they never truly have the power to say yes\n​\nSo be gentle with yourself; show yourself the same kindness and patience you might show a young child - the child you once were. If you wont be your own friend, who will be? If, when playing an opponent, you are also opposing yourself, you will be outnumbered.\n​\nIf babies held the same tendency toward self-criticism as adults, they might never learn to walk or talk.

A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by action makes your dreams a reality\n– Greg Reid\n​\nThe capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it’s not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person–without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other.\n– Osho\n​\nThe great paradox - when you are outwardly rich only then do you become aware of your inner poverty\n– Osho\n​\nOne Piece When Do You Think People Die?\nWhen They Are Shot In The Heart With A Pistol?

But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.\n– Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n​\nThe things you used to own, now they own you.\n– Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n​\nYou know how they say you only hurt the ones you love? Well, it works both ways.\n– Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n​\nWay of the Peaceful Warrior The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.\n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nA warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does.\n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nLife has three rules: Paradox, Humor, and Change.\nParadox: Life is a mystery; don’t waste your time trying to figure it out. Humor: Keep a sense of humor, especially about yourself. It is a strength beyond all measure Change: Know that nothing ever stays the same. – Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nThere is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It’s all the marvelous Play of God.

You are already free!\n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nIf you don’t get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don’t want, you suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can’t hold on to it forever.\n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nEveryone tells you what’s good for you. They don’t want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs.\n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nThe first step to change,… is accepting your reality right now. Honoring your process. Compassionate self-awareness leads to change; harsh self-criticism only holds the pattern in place, creating a stubborn and defensive basic self. Be gentle with yourself as you would with a child. Be gentle but firm. Give yourself the space to grow. But remember that the timing is in god’s hands, not yours. \n– Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n​\nThe Dark Knight / Batman Begins It’s not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us.\n– Batman Begins\n​\nIntroduce a little anarchy, upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos, I’m an agent of chaos , and you know the thing about chaos? It’s fair.\n– The Dark Knight\n​\nI took gotham’s white knight and I brought ‘im down to our level. Madness, as you know, is a lot like gravity, all it takes is a little push.\n– The Dark Knight\n​\nIf you’re good at something, never do it for free.\n– The Dark Knight\n​\nOthers A man interrupted one of the Buddha’s lectures with a flood of abuse. Buddha waited until he had finished and then asked him, “If a man offered a gift to another but the gift was declined, to whom the gift should belong?” The man replied “To the one who offered it.”\n“Then, I decline to accept your abuse and request you to keep it for yourself.”, said Buddha.\nDon’t accept the gift of a verbal abuse (or) angry criticism. Then it still belongs to the person who offered it.\n​\nMy wife and I have built a new home with a lovely garden which houses lovely bamboo trees.\nI got reading on the Chinese bamboo and learned that the tree takes 5 years, 3 months to grow to its whole height of 80 feet.\nYet, for the first 5 years, you only see a tiny green shoot, but in the next 90 days, it grows into a full-fledged tree.\nBut in those first 60 months, it is growing its strong network of roots underground, to support the tree.\nIn an era of instant gratification, we settle for shorter trees, but remember patience has its reward.\nThese are your years of growing that strong network of roots but be sure when you finally achieve your success, people will call it overnight success.\"\n– Rahul Dravid\n​\nSuccess hugs you in private but failure slaps you in public.\n​\nI used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, it’s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you fell all alone.\n​\nRandom What am I doing right now will help me reach my goal? Do or do not, there is no try.

asked him, &ldquo;If a man offered a gift to another but the gift was declined, to whom the gift should belong?&rdquo; The man
replied &ldquo;To the one who offered it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, I decline to accept your abuse and request you to keep it for yourself.&rdquo;, said Buddha.<br>Don&rsquo;t accept the gift of a verbal abuse (or) angry criticism. Then it still belongs to the person who offered it.</p></blockquote><p>​</p><blockquote><p>My wife and I have built a new home with a lovely garden which houses lovely bamboo trees.<br>I got reading on the Chinese bamboo and learned that the tree takes 5 years, 3 months to grow to its whole height
of 80 feet.<br>Yet, for the first 5 years, you only see a tiny green shoot, but in the next 90 days, it grows into a full-fledged
tree.<br>But in those first 60 months, it is growing its strong network of roots underground, to support the tree.<br>In an era of instant gratification, we settle for shorter trees, but remember patience has its reward.<br>These are your years of growing that strong network of roots but be sure when you finally achieve your success,
people will call it overnight success."</p><p>&ndash; Rahul Dravid</p></blockquote><p>​</p><blockquote><p>Success hugs you in private but failure slaps you in public.</p></blockquote><p>​</p><blockquote><p>I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, it&rsquo;s not. The worst thing in life is to end up
with people that make you fell all alone.</p></blockquote><p>​</p><h3 id=random>Random<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#random>#</a></h3><ul><li>What am I doing right now will help me
