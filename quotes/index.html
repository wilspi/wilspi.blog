I‚Äôm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It‚Äôs the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they‚Äôre going to do something incredibly ‚Ä¶ stupid!\n‚Äã\nWe mature with the damage not with the years.\nNeither one knows how much damage one has taken (from outside perspective) nor damage can be quantified, so age is a good universal metric (better than nothing) to judge maturity/experience ‚Äã\nPain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.

A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by action makes your dreams a reality\n‚Äì Greg Reid\n‚Äã\nThe capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it‚Äôs not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person‚Äìwithout possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other.\n‚Äì Osho\n‚Äã\nThe great paradox - when you are outwardly rich only then do you become aware of your inner poverty\n‚Äì Osho\n‚Äã\nThe suffering or the bad memories are as important as the good memories, and the good experiences. If you sort of, can imagine life as being 99% of the time quite linear, and most of the time you‚Äôre in a state of neither happiness nor sadness. And then that 1% of the time you experience moments of very crystalised happiness, or crystalised sadness, or loneliness or depression. And I believe all of those moments are very pertinant. It‚Äôs like I said to you, that for me it‚Äôs mostly those crystalised moments of melancholy which are more inspirational to me. And in a strange way they become quite beautiful in their own way. Music that is sad, melancholic, depressing, is in a kind of perverse way more uplifting. I find happy music extremely depressing, mostly - mostly quite depressing. It‚Äôs particularly this happy music that has no spirituality behind it - if it‚Äôs just sort of mindless party music, it‚Äôd be quite depressing. But largely speaking, I was the kind of person that responds more to melancholia, and it makes me feel good. And I think the reason for this is, I think if you respond strongly to that kind of art, it‚Äôs because in a way it makes you feel like you‚Äôre not alone. So when we hear a very sad song, it makes us realise that we do share this kind of common human experience, and we‚Äôre all kind of bonded in sadness and melancholia and depression.\n‚Äì Steven Wilson\n‚Äã\nOne Piece When Do You Think People Die?\nWhen They Are Shot In The Heart With A Pistol? No.\nWhen They Are Ravaged By An Uncurable Disease? No.\nWhen They Drink A Soup Made From Poisonous Mushrooms? No.\nIt‚Äôs when‚Ä¶ They Are Forgotten!\n‚Äì Dr. Hiriluk\n‚Äã\nInherited Will, The Destiny Of Age, The Dreams Of Its People.\nAs Long As People Continue To Pursue The Meaning Of Freedom, These Things Will Never Cease!\n‚Äì Gol D. Roger\n‚Äã\nFight Club It‚Äôs only after we‚Äôve lost everything that we‚Äôre free to do anything. ‚Äì Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n‚Äã\nWe‚Äôve all been raised on television to believe that one day we‚Äôd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won‚Äôt. And we‚Äôre slowly learning that fact. And we‚Äôre very, very pissed off.\n‚Äì Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n‚Äã\nThe things you used to own, now they own you.\n‚Äì Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n‚Äã\nYou know how they say you only hurt the ones you love? Well, it works both ways.\n‚Äì Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n‚Äã\nWay of the Peaceful Warrior The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.\n‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nA warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does.\n‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nLife has three rules: Paradox, Humor, and Change.\nParadox: Life is a mystery; don‚Äôt waste your time trying to figure it out. Humor: Keep a sense of humor, especially about yourself. It is a strength beyond all measure Change: Know that nothing ever stays the same. ‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nThere is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It‚Äôs all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don‚Äôt worry, just be happy. You are already free!\n‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nIf you don‚Äôt get what you want, you suffer;\nif you get what you don‚Äôt want, you suffer;\neven when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can‚Äôt hold on to it forever.\n‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nEveryone tells you what‚Äôs good for you.\nThey don‚Äôt want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs. ‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nThe first step to change,‚Ä¶ is accepting your reality right now. Honoring your process. Compassionate self-awareness leads to change; harsh self-criticism only holds the pattern in place, creating a stubborn and defensive basic self. Be gentle with yourself as you would with a child. Be gentle but firm. Give yourself the space to grow. But remember that the timing is in god‚Äôs hands, not yours.\n‚Äì Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n‚Äã\nThe Dark Knight / Batman Begins It‚Äôs not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us. ‚Äì Batman Begins\n‚Äã\nIntroduce a little anarchy, upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos, I‚Äôm an agent of chaos , and you know the thing about chaos? It‚Äôs fair.\n‚Äì The Dark Knight\n‚Äã\nI took gotham‚Äôs white knight and I brought ‚Äòim down to our level. Madness, as you know, is a lot like gravity, all it takes is a little push.\n‚Äì The Dark Knight\n‚Äã\nIf you‚Äôre good at something, never do it for free.\n‚Äì The Dark Knight\n‚Äã\nOthers ‚Äã\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\nOr, being lied about, don‚Äôt deal in lies,\nOr, being hated, don‚Äôt give way to hating,\nAnd yet don‚Äôt look too good, nor talk too wise;\nIf you can dream‚Äîand not make dreams your master;\nIf you can think‚Äîand not make thoughts your aim;\nIf you can meet with triumph and disaster\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you‚Äôve spoken\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\nOr watch the things you gave your life to broken,\nAnd stoop and build ‚Äôem up with wornout tools;\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\nExcept the Will which says to them: ‚ÄúHold on‚Äù;\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\nOr walk with kings‚Äînor lose the common touch;\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\nWith sixty seconds‚Äô worth of distance run‚Äî\nYours is the Earth and everything that‚Äôs in it,\nAnd‚Äîwhich is more‚Äîyou‚Äôll be a Man, my son!\n‚Äì Rudyard Kipling\n‚Äã\nA man interrupted one of the Buddha‚Äôs lectures with a flood of abuse. Buddha waited until he had finished and then asked him, ‚ÄúIf a man offered a gift to another but the gift was declined, to whom the gift should belong?‚Äù The man replied ‚ÄúTo the one who offered it.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, I decline to accept your abuse and request you to keep it for yourself.‚Äù, said Buddha.\nDon‚Äôt accept the gift of a verbal abuse (or) angry criticism. Then it still belongs to the person who offered it.\n‚Äã\nMy wife and I have built a new home with a lovely garden which houses lovely bamboo trees.\nI got reading on the Chinese bamboo and learned that the tree takes 5 years, 3 months to grow to its whole height of 80 feet.\nYet, for the first 5 years, you only see a tiny green shoot, but in the next 90 days, it grows into a full-fledged tree.\nBut in those first 60 months, it is growing its strong network of roots underground, to support the tree.\nIn an era of instant gratification, we settle for shorter trees, but remember patience has its reward.\nThese are your years of growing that strong network of roots but be sure when you finally achieve your success, people will call it overnight success.\"\n‚Äì Rahul Dravid\n‚Äã\nSuccess hugs you in private but failure slaps you in public.\n‚Äã\nI used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, it‚Äôs not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you fell all alone.\n‚Äã\nRandom What am I doing right now will help me reach my goal? Do or do not, there is no try.

It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of
being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person&ndash;without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other.</p><p>&ndash; Osho</p></blockquote><p>‚Äã</p><blockquote><p>The great paradox - when you are outwardly rich only then do you become aware of your inner poverty</p><p>&ndash; Osho</p></blockquote><p>‚Äã</p><blockquote><p>The suffering or the bad memories are as important as the good memories, and the good experiences. If you sort of, can imagine life as being 99% of the time quite linear, and most of the time you&rsquo;re in a state of neither happiness nor sadness. And then that 1% of the time you experience moments of very crystalised happiness, or crystalised sadness, or loneliness or depression. And I believe all of those moments are very pertinant. It&rsquo;s like I said to you, that for me it&rsquo;s mostly those crystalised moments of melancholy which are more inspirational to me. And in a strange way they become quite beautiful in their own way. <strong>Music that is sad, melancholic, depressing, is in a kind of perverse way more uplifting. I find happy music extremely depressing, mostly - mostly quite depressing.</strong> It&rsquo;s particularly this happy music that has no spirituality behind it - if it&rsquo;s just sort of mindless party music, it&rsquo;d be quite depressing. But largely speaking, I was the kind of person that responds more to melancholia, and it makes me feel good. And I think the reason for this is, I think if you respond strongly to that kind of art, it&rsquo;s because in a way it makes you feel like you&rsquo;re not alone. So when we hear a very sad song, it makes us realise that we do share this kind of common human experience, and we&rsquo;re all kind of bonded in sadness and melancholia and depression.</p><p>&ndash; Steven Wilson</p></blockquote><p>‚Äã</p><h4 id=one-piece>One Piece<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#one-piece>#</a></h4><blockquote><p>When Do You Think People Die?<br>When They Are Shot In The Heart With A Pistol?
