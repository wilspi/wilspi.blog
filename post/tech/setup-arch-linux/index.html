There are many tutorials and how-to pages to do so, but I found none to be exhaustive or seemless, so I decided to write my own.\nHere are the steps to install Arch Linux from scratch\nMake a bootable drive Download Arch Linux from here\nIf using Windows, download Rufus and create a bootable drive. If you are on Linux, you can use the dd command to create a live USB.\n​\nInstallation Insert your bootable drive and select “Install Arch Linux”.\nFollow below steps:\n  Verify boot mode\nls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars If the command shows the directory without error, then the system is booted in UEFI mode. If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in BIOS (or CSM) mode.\n  ​\n  Connect to Internet\n  Check network interfaces\nip link   For wifi:\nConnect Internet\niwctl --passphrase  station  connect  Replace , ,  appropriately.\n is wifi interface, use ip link to check yours.\n  Check if Internet is working\nping google.com       ​\n  Setup datetime\nSystem clock, read more here\n  Set Network Synchronization\ntimedatectl set-ntp true   Setting timezone, run timedatectl list-timezones to list all timezones\ntimedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata   Check if properly configured\ntimedatectl status   We will sync with hardware clock later.\n  ​\n  Partition devices\nNote: If you have dual boot, make sure you have already alloted blank space for linux partition. Else please do this in the current os (Windows for me).\n  Check partition volumes\nlsblk Output for me:\n  Minimum we need the following partitions:\n One partition for the root directory /. For booting in UEFI mode: an EFI system partition.  You can have separate partition for SWAP, and even your home directory, skipping this here.\n  Use fdisk to partition your drives.\nBe careful with the tool, it may delete your existing data and drives.\nIn my case, the drive was /dev/sdb, see below image:\nCreate a new partition using the tool (delete existing partition if required, be careful before you save your changes, you might lose your data on the drive).\n  Format the partition\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb5 Use the partition which you created with fdisk, for me it is /dev/sdb5\n  Format partition for UEFI filesystem (boot menu)\nIf reinstalling or replacing old linux distro, this would have been already there, so you can skip this. Replace with the partition you created, for me it is /dev/sdb1\nmkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1   Extra:\nIf using SWAP, format SWAP partition also, replace swap_partition\nmkswap /dev/swap_partition     ​\n  Mount the file system\nmount /dev/sdb5 /mnt Here, I mounted /dev/sdb5 which was my partition.\n  ​\n  Installation\n  Essential packages\npacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware vim vi     ​\n  Configurations\n  Fstab: Defines how disk partitions, various other block devices, or remote filesystems should be mounted into the filesystem\ngenfstab -U /mnt  /mnt/etc/fstab   Change root directory for the process (bootdrive)\nThis step is very important and all other configurations need to follow after this.\narch-chroot /mnt   Timezone\n  Local time configuration, see this\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime   Sync with hardware clock\nhwclock --systohc --utc     Localization\n  Edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\n  locale-gen   echo \"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\"  /etc/locale.conf     Network\nConfiguring hostname and hosts file\n  echo \"wilstation\"  /etc/hostname   echo \"127.0.0.1\tlocalhost ::1\tlocalhost 127.0.1.1\twilstation.localdomain\twilstation\"  /etc/hosts     Users\n  Create user and setup password, creating wilspi here\nuseradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash wilspi passwd wilspi   Sudoers\n  pacman -S sudo   echo \"root ALL=(ALL) ALL %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\"  /etc/sudoers   chown -c root:root /etc/sudoers chmod -c 0440 /etc/sudoers       Boot Configuration\n  pacman -S grub efibootmgr   mkdir /boot/efi   Note: Here, /dev/sdb1 (my UEFI partition) is mounted to /boot/efi\nmount /dev/sdb1 /boot/efi   grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=GRUB --efi-directory=/boot/efi   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg   mkinitcpio -P     Root Password\n  passwd       ​\n  Desktop Environment (GNOME)\nSetting up GNOME as my desktop environment, you can use any other from here\n  pacman -S xorg gnome   systemctl enable gdm.service     ​\n  Pre final steps\nWe are almost done, setting up drivers and enabling services.\n  Graphics driver\npacman -S nvidia nvidia  pkg works for my graphics driver, check here for your driver.\n  Enable NetworkManager\nsystemctl enable NetworkManager.service You can use other managers as well.\n  Enable Bluetooth\nsystemctl enable bluetooth.service     ​\n  Final steps before rebooting\n  Unmount uefi partition\numount /boot/efi   Exit chroot\nexit   Unmount system partition\numount /mnt   Reboot\nreboot now     ​\nPost Installation After logging in,\nAdd wifi details:\nnmcli device wifi connect  password  nmcli is cli tool for NetworkManager\nInstall packages:\nsudo pacman -S amd-ucode git bash-completion ntfs-3g pacman-contrib firefox net-tools gnome-tweak-tool Setup yay for AUR:\n# Install yay git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git cd yay/ makepkg -si cd .. \u0026\u0026 rm -rf yay ​\nRemedies   GDM takes too much time to reboot, sometimes get stuck on loading screen. This happens because nvidia drivers are not getting loaded before gdm.\nAdd nvidia modules in MODULES in file: /etc/mkinitcpio.conf, see below:\nMODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)Rebuild image:\nmkinitcpio -P More details: Nvidia page on Arch Wiki\n  Sometimes due to some mishap (configs/packages go outdated, you missed installing something) you are not able to connect to Internet. You can chroot into the machine and fix the network issue.\n Reload the bootloader Load into the terminal (by choosing installing Arch) Setup your internet Change root to your system using chroot    ​\nSystem Screenshots Keeping it simple silly.\n   ​\n   ​\n   ",
