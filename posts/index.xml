Sigmund Freud&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Ego and the Id&amp;rdquo; (1923) formulates the structural personality model in which he articulates a map of the different layers which comprise the human soul: the conscious, unconscious and preconscious which correlate with the faculties of ego, id and super-ego.
Captures Chapter 1: Consciousness and What is Unconscious
‘Being conscious’ is in the first place a purely descriptive term, resting on perception of the most immediate and certain character.</description></item><item><title>'The Liberation of Sita' By Volga - Thoughts and Notes</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/the-liberation-of-sita/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/the-liberation-of-sita/</guid><description>Thoughts Does Ramayana qualify for a feminist fiction?
For argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, lets consider Ramayana is a true story.
Post Ram and Sita&amp;rsquo;s homecoming, Sita was asked to give a chastity test, and she left the palace after proving herself. She could have left without undergoing the test but then the crowd would have believed that indeed she was at fault.
Being a woman and fighting for yourself in those ages is feministic (and applause worthy).</description></item><item><title>Seven Deadly Sins</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/7-deadly-sins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/7-deadly-sins/</guid><description>The way we behave is mostly influenced by our surroundings (by law of averages you shall become average of folks you spend time with, over a long period of time) until and unless we mindfully start tweaking these behaviours.
Here, as the title suggests, I write about these conventional vices with the aim to define/understand them better, most of which are the basis of our sufferings.
The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings.</description></item><item><title>'Parasyte' By Hitoshi Iwaaki - Thoughts and Notes</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/parasyte/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/parasyte/</guid><description>Parasyte is a manga/anime that deals on some pretty heavy subjects regarding the existence of humans.

Whenever we are hurt/harmed or have been at the end of an unsatisfying or unfavourable situation, we replay the situation and try to judge each and every action, of ourselves and of others. We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.
There are frameworks to better understand and analyse your/others' actions, one such framework that has helped me to judge these situations is &amp;ldquo;Intention Vs Action&amp;rdquo;.
​
Whenever there is a conflict in your life and if you confront the other person, they often don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge the harm happened.</description></item><item><title>'Animal Farm' By George Orwell - Thoughts and Notes</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/animal-farm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/animal-farm/</guid><description>The book is a satire on Communism.

The book is not yet complete, but will keep adding my thoughts and notes here.

You can play here.
The Game Mechanics? There are some number tiles on the board (4x4). The number on the tile will be a power of 2 with minimum being 2.</description></item><item><title>Save the production with Nginx hack</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</guid><description>Quick nginx hack to save your production web server in case the web service starts crashing.

Face the conflict and pro-actively seek to understand what lies at its root. An enemy or adversary is someone who seeks to do you harm. You and your family no doubt have disagreements, but everyone works for the same goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
