The book formulates the structural personality model in which he articulates a map of the different layers which comprise the human soul: the conscious, unconscious and preconscious which correlate with the faculties of ego, id and super-ego.
Captures Chapter 1: Consciousness and What is Unconscious
‘Being conscious’ is in the first place a purely descriptive term, resting on perception of the most immediate and certain character.</description></item><item><title>'The Liberation of Sita' By Volga - Book Notes</title><link>https://wilspi.com/n/the-liberation-of-sita/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/n/the-liberation-of-sita/</guid><description>Thoughts Does Ramayana qualify for a feminist fiction?
For argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, lets consider Ramayana is a true story.
Post Ram and Sita&amp;rsquo;s homecoming, Sita was asked to give a chastity test, and she left the palace after proving herself. She could have left without undergoing the test but then the crowd would have believed that indeed she was at fault.
Being a woman and fighting for yourself in those ages is feministic (and applause worthy).</description></item><item><title>2022</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</guid><description>​

Whenever we are hurt/harmed or have been at the end of an unsatisfying or unfavourable situation, we replay the situation and try to judge each and every action, of ourselves and of others. We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.
There are frameworks to better understand and analyse your/others&amp;rsquo; actions, one such framework that has helped me to judge these situations is &amp;ldquo;Intention Vs Action&amp;rdquo;.

In this post I will be creating a small game, 2048 in Elm. 2048 is a game created by gabrielecirulli which went viral in 2014.
I chose 2048 because the game mechanics are simple which will help us understand Elm clearly. Also, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make another todo app.
You can play here.

The Game Mechanics? There are some number tiles on the board (4x4). The number on the tile will be a power of 2 with minimum being 2.</description></item><item><title>Save the production with Nginx hack</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</guid><description>​

Face the conflict and pro-actively seek to understand what lies at its root. An enemy or adversary is someone who seeks to do you harm. You and your family no doubt have disagreements, but everyone works for the same goals. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to subdue those you love and care about; you want to support them.</description></item><item><title>2020</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</guid><description>​
