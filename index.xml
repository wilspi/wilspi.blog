What a brilliant movie, such amalgamation of culture, story, socio-political issues. All kudos to writing and screenplay. The basic story is very common trope, connecting it to the culture (which is new to everyone) was the key. The story didn;t go overboard with the mythology part, it was all believable and realistic. Fantastically told story. The demigod connecting the bridges between man (protagonist) and the nature (forest officer). The story didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of twists and turns, but still kept me hooked.</description></item><item><title>Top Gun Maverick - my thoughts | wilspi</title><link>https://wilspi.com/reviews/top-gun-maverick-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/reviews/top-gun-maverick-2022/</guid><description>I recently watched Top Gun and was not sure if this movie can offer anything more (with Tom Cruise in lead), probably more training and fighting jet sequences. Oh boy I was in for a ride. This was a new chapter with the same characters, and the writers connected it all so well. It was a continuation. After 30min, audience knew where the story would go, but the pace of the movie kept changing, the twists were good.</description></item><item><title>How to deal with introversion</title><link>https://wilspi.com/n/introversion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/n/introversion/</guid><description>Introversion Introversion is a personality trait characterized by a preference for solitude and a decreased need for social stimulation. While there is nothing inherently wrong with being introverted, it can sometimes pose challenges in certain situations, such as networking events, job interviews, or social gatherings.
Introversion is a spectrum Introvert - Extrovert is a spectrum. Nobody is pure extrovert or introvert, we all fall somewhere in between.
Labeling ourselves with one way or the other is counterproductive as we are very good in pattern matching and we see what we want to see.</description></item><item><title>'A Marriage Knot' By Shobana Mahadevan - Book Notes</title><link>https://wilspi.com/n/book-a-marriage-knot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/n/book-a-marriage-knot/</guid><description>Thoughts Feel good book Classic love story, uses common tropes aunt is bad, uncle is good but helpless, mother-in-law is good and supportive the female lead gets saved by a prince (in terms of both qualities and riches) and she is looking for basic respect and freedom - classic damsel in distress the male lead gets pushed by the female lead and he acknowledges his responsibilities and finds his strength, he gets challenged by the female&amp;rsquo;s thought process and in turn keeps falling for her both complete each other, opposites attract (if both complement each other), which is the case here No strong conflict: Both (female and male leads) lack any negative trait, the resolution of their conflict is merely a conversation away - what they agreed upon and what they want now Captures Look dear.</description></item><item><title>I saw the Devil - my thoughts | wilspi</title><link>https://wilspi.com/reviews/i-saw-the-devil-2010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/reviews/i-saw-the-devil-2010/</guid><description> I rewatched this movie recently, the movie is a classic gore movie.</description></item><item><title>Antim - my thoughts | wilspi</title><link>https://wilspi.com/reviews/antim-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/reviews/antim-2021/</guid><description>Antim Timepass movie.</description></item><item><title>Bhediya - my thoughts | wilspi</title><link>https://wilspi.com/reviews/bhediya-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/reviews/bhediya-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bullet Train - my thoughts | wilspi</title><link>https://wilspi.com/reviews/bullet-train-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/reviews/bullet-train-2022/</guid><description> Nice action movie with a good story and nice concept.

First published in the 1960s and recognized as a classic work of its kind by professionals, the bestselling &amp;lsquo;Games People Play&amp;rsquo; is also an accessible and fascinating read. It is a wise, original, witty and very sensible analysis of the games we play in order to live with one another and with ourselves.

&amp;ldquo;The Ego and the Id&amp;rdquo; (1923) is a prominent paper (also book) by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis.
The book formulates the structural personality model in which he articulates a map of the different layers which comprise the human soul: the conscious, unconscious and preconscious which correlate with the faculties of ego, id and super-ego.

Thoughts Does Ramayana qualify for a feminist fiction?
Post Ram and Sita&amp;rsquo;s homecoming, Sita was asked to give a chastity test, and she left the palace after proving herself. She could have left without undergoing the test but then the public would have indeed believed that she was at fault.
Whether Ramayana is based on true events or if it&amp;rsquo;s a fictional tale it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, in either case Sita&amp;rsquo;s character is liberating.</description></item><item><title>2022 🔗</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</guid><description>29/12/2022

Hero (or a good-doer) is often confused with the problem of &amp;ldquo;to be or not to be&amp;rdquo;, while the villain does what he thinks, so the fan-following is tilted more towards the villain because confidence attracts. If the hero is not stuck in the &amp;ldquo;to be or not to be&amp;rdquo; zone and is clear and confident and acts on things and his beliefs quickly, he shall gets all the attraction.</description></item><item><title>Seven Deadly Sins</title><link>https://wilspi.com/n/7-deadly-sins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/n/7-deadly-sins/</guid><description>​

Whenever we are hurt/harmed or have been at the end of an unsatisfying or unfavourable situation, we replay the situation and try to judge each and every action, of ourselves and of others. We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.

Summary Calculation When you encounter a conflict in your life, before you act, seek out a solitary place that balances and enhances your mind to spiritually think things through.
Face the conflict and pro-actively seek to understand what lies at its root. An enemy or adversary is someone who seeks to do you harm. You and your family no doubt have disagreements, but everyone works for the same goals. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to subdue those you love and care about; you want to support them.</description></item><item><title>2020 🔗</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</guid><description>​

My name is Sourabh and welcome to my blog.
Here, I explore the fascinating worlds of philosophy, psychology, and more.
