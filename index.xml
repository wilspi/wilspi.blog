Whenever we are hurt/harmed or have been at the end of an unsatisfying or unfavourable situation, we replay the situation and try to judge each and every action, of ourselves and of others. We often reflect upon the incident from various lenses.

I chose 2048 because the game mechanics are simple which will help us understand Elm clearly. Also, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make another todo app.
You can play here.
The Game Mechanics? There are some number tiles on the board (4x4). The number on the tile will be a power of 2 with minimum being 2.</description></item><item><title>Save the production with Nginx hack</title><link>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/p/save-production-via-nginx/</guid><description>Quick nginx hack to save your production web server in case the web service starts crashing.
If you have been working in a production environment, you know at certain times your web service can crash due to some unknown reason (code failure). It will take some time to do the RCA and fix the issue.
