Thoughts Does Ramayana qualify for a feminist fiction?
Post Ram and Sita&amp;rsquo;s homecoming, Sita was asked to give a chastity test, and she left the palace after proving herself. She could have left without undergoing the test but then the public would have indeed believed that she was at fault.
Whether Ramayana is based on true events or if it&amp;rsquo;s a fictional tale it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, in either case Sita&amp;rsquo;s character is liberating.</description></item><item><title>2022 üîó</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2022/</guid><description>‚Äã

Hero (or a good-doer) is often confused with the problem of &amp;ldquo;to be or not to be&amp;rdquo;, while the villain does what he thinks, so the fan-following is tilted more towards the villain because confidence attracts.

Summary Calculation When you encounter a conflict in your life, before you act, seek out a solitary place that balances and enhances your mind to spiritually think things through.
Face the conflict and pro-actively seek to understand what lies at its root. An enemy or adversary is someone who seeks to do you harm. You and your family no doubt have disagreements, but everyone works for the same goals. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to subdue those you love and care about; you want to support them.</description></item><item><title>2020 üîó</title><link>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://wilspi.com/link-log/2020/</guid><description>‚Äã
