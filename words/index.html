The previous generation need not be 10-20yrs older, it could be our immediate seniors (as in office or college). Values which are celebrated flourish, and as a culture it becomes part of the community You celebrate the outcome for which a certain skill/value is required, which you want everyone to have in your community. Eg: you celebrate production releases (with afterparty), which mean we celebrate even small wins (work hard party harder?). Eg: if you want a culture of innovation - this means you will have to find a way to identify and reward (in a way celebrate) the engineers who do innovation. Customs (religious, ancestral, national etc.) are celebrations which promote certain values or ideas Eg: Patriarch is celebrated via various customs. Ideas evolve with time, with society. And hence customs which celebrate a regressive idea needs to be evolved too. Sometimes in the name of the value (which the community celebrates), people go extreme (maybe to get rewarded - with fame, respect, financially etc.). ​\nEducation “A good education is one where kids graduate being extremely aware of what they are good at, having had plenty of experience creating and building different things, failing and then trying again and getting feedback until they nail something, and having that desire to keep learning”\n– Ana Fabrega “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think”\n– Albert Einstein ​\nEgo Ego holds while love liberates Ego is you thinking what others think about you, and then comparing it with your own version of yourself. If the act itself is unjustifiable then it is fine, but if the actor becomes more important than the act, then it’s ego. Self esteem is what you want to do, whom you want to meet.

Why would you want to get on that trolley?” Jealousy is a corrosive, counter-productive, and pointless waste of time. Just say no to the green-eyed monster. ​\nEnlightenment When does one seek enlightenment? Or he has sought it? When he is fulfilled, when he doesn’t strive for hunger, when troubles of work doesn’t bother him, when he understands that the path, he is walking on, only can push him forward. The end of suffering is enlightenment, Nirvana. Enlightenment cannot be described, only experienced. All human beings have experienced glimpses of enlightenment ​\nEthics Right Vs Wrong in a social context Morals is right vs wrong in a personal context Eg: Where do you each the line with lying and when it;s wrong, what is considered disrespectful, how do you determine fairness, what cultural rules do you adhere to etc. ​\nFaith Any belief, which does not have any rationale/logic behind it, is faith From reason, faith is another word for stupidity ​\nFear Phobia -\u003e anticipation of pain in the future because of the pain in the past Here the degree of pain in unknown unknown ​\nFeminism Tries to liberate anything and anyone that is feminine or that is perceived as feminine.\nEvery human being has both feminine and masculine traits but our society is designed to look down upon the feminine and make it secondary to the masculine.\nFor example, a man shouldn’t cry.\nHarmony only when we embrace both these sides of human psyche, unless we do we find ourselves constantly at war with ourselves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jbZmvFoVCM\n​\nFreedom It is not being able to do things you love, it is free will Freedom is not free, it comes at a cost ​\nFriendship Measure of friendship is directly proportional to time, best/close friends are those tested over time. No one is truly your friend until they have seen he worst of you and still stayed. A long time makes sure they have seen different shades of you. “All the benefits in life come from compound interest - relationship, money, habits - anything of importance.” - Naval How to make friends Share your thoughts, your pov, talk about yourself. If the other person cares and wants to be friends he/she will listen, and eventually he/she will also want to talk about his/her perspective, his/her life, then you listen carefully. This is how you make connections. You don;t have to talk about meaningless things, by meaningless I mean things which are niether constant nor does hold any importance (preferably long-term) to you or the other person, example: pop culture. Things you talk about defines your relation. “All happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle ​\nGenius “Persistence and variety. These are the two primary ways to develop great ideas or to solve important problems.\nKeep leaning your head against a topic for a long time. Certainly for weeks, possibly for years.

Desire is blocked by fear or comparison or insecurity or stress. ​\nKarma Karma originates from a false belief in an ego, which prompts a chain reaction of defending that false sense of self and trying to maintain some security. However, there is no security anywhere and people can find no resting place. There is nothing substanial in the world of Samsara. People are ignorant of their true nature, and that ignorance causes them to suffer over and over again ​\nLeader “Having been brought up in a serf owner’s family, I entered active life, like all young men of my time, with a great deal of confidence in the necessity of commanding, ordering, scolding, punishing, and the like. But when, at an early stage, I had to manage serious enterprises and to deal with [free] men, and when each mistake would lead at once to heavy consequences, I began to appreciate the difference between acting on the principle of command and discipline and acting on the principle of common understanding. The former works admirably in a military parade, but it is worth nothing where real life is concerned, and the aim can be achieved only through the severe effort of many converging wills.” https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/923421-having-been-brought-up-in-a-serf-owner-s-family-i-entered Embrace your first few followers as equal, if you do that, it becomes about them (about the movement) and is not about the leader anymore First Follower: Underappreciated, needs guts to be the first follower Leadership is over-glorified, it is the first follower who transforms a lone nut into a leader Courageously follow and show others how to follow https://sive.rs/ff Be public, be easy to follow People follow the one who shows the light, and eventually unfollow if the light goes dimmer or doesn’t shine anymore. Leader is the one who in tough situations says I will get this fuckin done. Courage, taking responsibility of one’s decisions. Absolute justice and impartiality: By this way you may not be liked by all but be respected. Qualities must possess: Influence: Most of the time we are stuck in opinions and never come on a common ground, this affects productivity. A leader must be able to influence in these times to move a certain way. Courage and thick skin: Needs guts to stand alone and look ridiculous “Organizations should reward risk-takers, even if they fall short once in a while. Let them know that promotions and glory go to innovators and pioneers, not to stand-patters who fear controversy and avoid trying to improve anything.” - fs blog ​\nLife Give yourself a second chance “I know now, after fifty years, that the finding/losing, forgetting/remembering, leaving/returning, never stops. The whole of life is about another chance, and while we are alive, till the very end, there is always another chance.” - Jeanette Winterson Life is an experience, and how come an experience be better. ​\nLove Love is a habit, an addiction Love liberates The highest form of love is “self sacrifice” “Love is not a relationship, love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not “in love”, one is love. And of course when one is love, one is in love – but that is an outcome, a by-product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.” - Osho ​\nLoyalty Two-way street, one can rightfully demand it from subordinate if he/she is also loyal to them. Also if I’m asking for it from you then you’re getting it from me. Does need for loyalty stems from loneliness?

We often say “Maturity comes with age”, does the loss of age makes the person mature? ​ ​\nMorals Right Vs Wrong in a personal context Ethics is right Vs wrong in a social context Rules you live by: do you cheat, are you generous, are you patient, are your truthful etc. “If you crush a cockroach, you’re a hero. If you crush a beautiful butterfly, you’re a villain. Morals have aesthetic criteria.” - Nietzsche ​\nNetworking “Networking is overrated. Become first and foremost a person of value and the network will be available whenever you need it.” - Naval How to network Help Ask for help Talk about your thesis (Talking points, your essays, your words) Ask them about their journey, their unique experiences Listen: To be a good listener, you have to stop talking and be interested Questions: What is the one thing that you know that others don’t? Example: Tanmay Bhat ​\nNitpickers Littleman - Contribute to nothing and try to bring other people down, they don’t like the words you use, they don’t Eg: “Vulnerable - Oh I don’t like that word, it doesn’t fit, what you mean to say is open, human and natural” ​\nNostalgia Best and worst feeling (of a past memory) at the same time ​\nObjectification What is objectifying?

In this case calling a black person black is justifiable? why or why not? Racism as a mean to oppress/bully is incorrect/unjustified ​\nRejection Rejection (by someone else) is nothing but projection of someone’s own fears and insecurities onto another person ​\nSalary Selling freedom\n“I don’t care how rich you are.\nI don’t care whether you’re a top Wall Street banker.\nIf somebody has to tell you when to be at work, what to wear and how to behave, you’re not a free person.\nYou’re not actually rich.” - @Naval\n​\nSelf Esteem The sense of self-esteem is strengthened in the same environment where personal differences are respected there is tolerance for mistakes there is transparency in communication there is absence of judgment there is potential for advancement equality is protected Self-esteem is a state of confidence in not only how you feel now, but how you will feel in the future. ​\nSkill “There’s a quick and easy way to test whether an activity involves skill: ask whether you can lose on purpose.” Michael Mauboussin, The Success Equation You cannot lose on purpose at Roulette, or the lottery, which makes them all about luck. But, you can lose on purpose at Chess, which means there has to be skill involved.\nBeing able to lose on purpose proves that an activity is not all about luck and that some skill is involved. ​\nSophist A person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments different meaning from etymology ​\nSpirituality Is this the outcome or the idea - Having control over your feelings ? ​\nShame “Intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.” - Brene Brown\nSuperego kicking the shit out of the ego\nIt is an auto-vivisection of the soul. As we are all well aware the painful flush of shame feels terrible. But there is something specific in this terribleness that you might not have noticed. It’s in your inner dialogue - shame is self-directed. With shame you are the problem; you are the crux of all that has gone wrong.\nShame Vs Guilt\nShame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behaviour ​\nStrategy an overall plan to reach your goal Tactic: the individual actions that support your strategy ​\nStress “Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over” - Jeff Bezos Procrastination is the mother of stress.
